Hello Everyone,

Welcome to the 8th edition of our weekly series, during which we perform technical analysis on the total crypto market capitalization (TCAP).

To familiarize yourself with the indicators and concepts we discuss here, [please refer to my intro post](https://cryptex.finance/blog/2021-10-09-tcap-technical-analysis-intro-post/), which is a detailed introduction/overview of technical analysis, and the indicators we will be using in these weekly posts. Also, you can find [last week's analysis here.](https://cryptex.finance/blog/2021-12-27-total-crypto-market-capitalization-weekly-technical-analysis-7-dec-27th-2021/)

The information we present here can be utilized for profit using $TCAP, the first synthetic & collateralized asset which encompasses the entire crypto market. Find all the info on $TCAP and how you can use it as a tool for your benefit and as a hedge against your investments in singular assets here - [About Cryptex Finance](https://cryptex.finance/#about)

However, for this analysis, we will be using the TOTAL crypto market chart (Calculated by TradingView). I am using TOTAL since the $TCAP chart has not matured enough to provide a complete picture of the market's history. Later on, as time progresses, we will switch our analysis to the $TCAP chart, as it allows us to make hypothetical investments and apply them to our study.

DISCLAIMER: These articles will represent my thoughts and are in no way intended to be used as a recommendation or as financial advice. This is for educational and research purposes ONLY. I want to re-state that we will be adopting an agnostic/neutral view of the market. We will not be thinking about what we want/wish to happen but instead what we believe will most likely occur.

TA is simply deriving the events that we think have the highest probability of occurring, not predicting the future. Life can always throw us a curveball or two. With that being said, let's get into this week's analysis:

## Daily Chart

![](/img/daily-01-10-copy.jpg)

**Analysis:** In the last two installments of this analysis, we predicted that a ‘Head & Shoulders’ pattern was forming. We can see now that the formation is complete. The price has arrived back to a place of support around $1.8T, which I have represented using the blue line. So there could be a slight bounce up to the resistance line, which I have drawn in orange around $2.1T. The support used to be resistance back in August - July and acted as support in September. The Resistance line acted as support/resistance during August - October. Remember, resistance becomes support and vise versa as a rule.

However, after hitting support, the chances of the price going lower after completing a Head & Shoulders formation are higher than the chances for recovery.



If we run a Fib Retracement/Extension analysis:

Analysis: We can see resistance lines at $2T and $2.1T, which match what we have deduced from the chart above. So we now have double confirmation that $2.1T will act as a resistance level. According to this analysis, the resistance above that lies around $2.4T. We can also notice that $1.8T comes up as a support level, giving us double confirmation that this is indeed an area of support. Below, support levels are at $1.7T and $1.5T, respectively. Anything below that seems to lead to a massive drop to just over $1T Total Market Capitalization (TCAP).

I would like to also look at the 20, 50, and 200 Day Simple Moving Averages:

![](/img/simple-moving-avg-01-10-copy.jpg)

**Analysis:** We can see the 200 SMA (red line) is at $2.1T. As we know, the 200 Day SMA will most likely act as a hard point of resistance. Furthermore, we know that the Fibonacci extension/retracement analysis & our analysis based on the Head & Shoulders pattern also pointed to $2.1T being a point of resistance. This gives us triple confirmation that $2.1T is a resistance point. We can confidently assume it will be a **HARD RESISTANCE POINT**.

However, the price is well under any SMA currently, thus some bulls will be enticed by the ‘clear airspace’ and will use this opportunity to squeeze out some ‘long profits. This is why I expect the TCAP price to bounce at this level as it waits for the other 2 SMAs to drop down to meet it. We can see that there will likely be a Death Cross soon, which is when the 50 Day SMA crosses under the 200 Day SMA. This usually indicates that the price will go lower. It usually becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy because many people will have already sold in its anticipation by the time it happens. Thus, after the price recovers and hits the hard resistance point of $2.1T, there will be much resistance that will induce fear and selling both because of the proximity to the 3 SMAs and the anticipation of the ‘Death Cross.’

### Daily Indicators:

![](/img/daily-indicators-01-10-copy.jpg)

* **MACD:** Looks like it is curling up from big bearish cross. Could be an extra indication of short term price recovery.
* **RSI:** Has found support after touching oversold levels. Also could indicate short term recovery.
* **OBV:** Still curling down indicating price will go lower.

## Weekly Chart

![](/img/weekly-01-10-copy.jpg)

**Analysis:** The most notable thing to me here is that for the first time since May 2020, when TCAP was only ~$250B, the price dipped under the 50 Week SMA. I view that as a HUGE break in a long-term trend. The only thing that de-legitimizes this instance is that it was a rapid and relatively insignificant drop that barely touched under the blue line. However, if we look at the four other times the price dropped under the blue line, it always went on to touch if not drop under the 200 Week SMA. If we should see the price drop significantly under the 50 Day SMA, history tells us there is almost a sure chance the price will continue to drop until it at least touches the red line at just over $700B TCAP.

*Could this mean a long-term bear market is coming?* If you look at May 2021’s dip on this chart, you can see that the price did not drop under the 50 Week SMA before recovering from putting in a new ATH within 3-4 months. Traditionally, you would not refer to this as a ‘bear market.’ This, however, might be the first sign of a more prolonged actual bear market that will see the price touch the 200 Week SMA.

*What could this mean for the price of Bitcoin, for example?* Currently, the market cap of BTC is ~$800B alone. BTC represents around 41% of the Total Crypto Market Capitalization. If the TCAP stood at $700B total, and BTC represented 41% of that total, the MCAP of BTC would be $287B. That would put the price of each coin at around $14,000.

*Is this possible?* The 2018 crash saw the TCAP go from \~$760B to \~$90B at its lowest or an 88% drop. If the TCAP were to go from a high of $3T to $700B today, that would represent a 78% drop. So, according to history, it is possible, and it is actually what will be expected.

The price HAS to recover at this point, or it is looking like a major turning point in the market's direction for the foreseeable future.

### Weekly Indicators

**MACD:** On a freefall, no sign of curling up, indicating price will continue lower.

* **RSI:** Slight bump up on a clear Head & Shoulders pattern. Rsi seems at support of Head & Shoulders, but has yet to touch oversold levels. I expect it to drop to at least touch oversold levels.
* **OBV:** Headed downward under support. Indicates price will continue lower.

## Monthly Chart

![](/img/monthly-01-10-copy.jpg)

**Analysis:** Very interesting to note that the 50 Month SMA is at $1.4T, which is a level indicated to be as support on the Fib Extension/Retracement analysis we did on the daily chart. Another interesting thing to notate is that the 50 Month SMA is at around $700B, where we also predicted support.

According to the Monthly chart, the TCAP of the crypto market has yet to experience a dip under the 50 Month SMA, so we can expect the $700B levels to be extremely strong. It also would maintain the overall bullish sentiment of the market's total capitalization as a whole. It will continue to be on an uptrend, represented by the blue line. We need to manage our expectations and realize that the market will expand and contract many times; as long as it does so, it will continue to grow overall. The market may need time to mature before its next ATH.

### Monthly Indicators

![](/img/monthly-indicators-01-10-copy.jpg)

* **MACD:** Just hit a bearish cross on monthly chart for the first time since May of 2020. HUGE BEARISH SIGNAL AND BREAK OF TREND.
* **RSI:** Dropping sharply lower under resistance. Indicating price will continue lower.
* **OBV:** Dropping sharply under resistance. Indicating price will continue lower.
