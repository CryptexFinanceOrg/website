Cryptex (CTX) the protocol and community behind Total Crypto Market Cap token (TCAP), is constantly inspired and impressed with the creators and builders of web3. Cryptex created Space Invaders to help people get an inside look into the minds of the most important web3 creators and builders of our time.

On October 21st, 2021 Cryptex welcomed BFresh and Joe, Cofounder of Cryptex, as our hosts. Cryptex featured Mike Dudas as our guest for the eighth episode of Space Invaders. Mike is the founder of The Block and an investor. Typically these episodes are recorded live on Twitter Spaces then published on YouTube and a variety of podcast platforms.

In this post, we are sharing the most thought-provoking and alpha-infused pieces of the conversation. These are things most people would not get a chance to find out unless they were listening to the conversation at air time, which you can find on our Youtube channel and podcast formats.

Read on for the alpha leaks from Space Invaders Episode 8 with Mike Dudas from TheBlock.

## Involvement with Crypto

**BFresh:** I don't think people realize how big New York is in the crypto scene and we're going to touch on that as one of the topics tonight. It's going to be a great conversation. Just to get things started, Mike, what got you involved in crypto?

**Mike:** So in 2013, I was working at Venmo actually here in New York. You know, it's a payment processor now owned by PayPal, similar to what Stripe does, basically developer-oriented payments. And we had Airbnb and Uber and a bunch of other big mobile phone companies as customers. And we said, "Hey, Bitcoin sounds really interesting for payments", because at the time and still today the cost of accepting a credit card payment for e-commerce, an online or mobile merchant, was like 2.5% or 3%. You get a hundred bucks and $3 of that is going to the issuing bank, the card networks, et cetera.

So Bitcoin had some promise as the sort of global censorship-resistant, open payment network at the time. Obviously, the narrative and the primary use case of Bitcoin has changed over the years. But anyway, that's when I got interested in crypto for the first time, purchased some Bitcoin, and didn't really think much about it for probably three or four years. Basically, you know, until it started going up. I started a company in between and it was in the mobile commerce space and yeah, I just didn't think a lot about crypto. So obviously, I missed the sort of genesis of the theory, and was really a Bitcoin maximalist until 2020. But yeah, the first exciting reason I got into crypto was the promise of lower-cost payments and global money movement outside of the traditional banking system.

**BFresh:** That being said, how was your life different now than compared to your web 2.0 days? I'm sure you had some sort of like vision, some sort of belief in your mind, did that change when you moved into crypto?

**Mike:** Yeah. So look, obviously just about everything that we work on requires a really deep belief that major entrenched, accepted government, establishments, and codified systems are going to look substantially different and, or lose their power over time. And that these bottom-up grassroots, open-source, decentralized, for the people, owned by a collective group of folks, networks are going to, if not fully replaced them, at least provide like a really significant alternative to them. I think it's getting clearer and clearer every day that, more and more people believe that.

You have to have some sort of fervor, a sort of buy-in that's different than if you're just making an incremental improvement to the legacy financial system. Like most of what FinTech is. I mean, certainly, there's some technological wonder that happens, below the surface. But it's an incremental improvement and papering over things that exist in the financial system. Crypto is a completely, for the most part, a bottom-up reworking of how we think about trusted parties, value exchange between people and ownership of everything: apps, network services, and how we organize as people to accomplish common objectives. It's completely and entirely different than working in a traditional FinTech job or traditional tech job.

**BFresh:** A lot of people are kind of making that move from working with those jobs in traditional finance to the DeFi space. I think a lot of people are moving, not only for the financial gain from it, but also just like the social part of it, you know what I mean? Like we're working, we're working towards a common goal.

**Mike:** Yeah, absolutely. What's heartening is, we're starting to see real progress. So if you look at the metrics in terms of, number of wallets, people who own crypto, people spending time using different applications like collective community groups. We're moving beyond just crypto as like pure speculation and just betting on token prices, which it was for a long time.

## NFTs

**BFresh:** We're gonna start talking about NFTs. What about this space excites you guys the most? I know you guys clearly are big fans of PFP \[profile picture] projects as we call them. I know technically the Crypto Punks and the Bored Ape are a lot more than that, but what excites you the most about the NFT space?

**Joe:** I remember when I bought the Ape, one of the first people that I talked about it was Mike. I said, "Look, I want to sink my teeth into something". And I just remember him writing me back, like "Yo, just diamond hand, just buy it". I just diamond-handed. The community is there and for me that was the biggest driver for purchasing it because obviously, you could buy a lot of things, but, you're buying this image and you're like, "Okay, what am I doing?".

But when you really research it and you get into the community factor of these and you start to realize that you're not necessarily just buying an image, you're purchasing into a community. And if a community is cultivated right, it's going to grow. And if it grows, then there's going to be benefits to all parties involved. So for me, seeing what could be done with music, it's literally the tip of the iceberg here. Wait until, you have artists, you have record labels, you have all these different people realizing that they could take these videos or these songs or these artworks, and cultivate a community, around the artists, of people who are interested in that - artists that now want to purchase their NFTs. So the community is going to be the biggest driver. And for me looking at the Apes or the Punks, that was what really excited me about it.

**Mike:** You know, I just actually sold an NFT today, that I made money on and I was like, ecstatic. It was the first time. And I was like, geez, who's buying this off of me. Like I couldn’t believe it. But so the beauty of NFTs, so, there are a few things. One is that it's wildly incredible to be able to trade globally with basically zero restrictions in funny internet money, these assets, speculative assets, that anybody can own. It's wonderful, right? I think NFTs, like nobody can deny that maybe the central part of the attraction from most of the ”collectors” is the fact that you can speculate on the value of art, collectibles, and other assets, you know, in real-time with anybody in the world, in internet funny money that doesn't feel like you're spending dollars.

Once you accept that, and then you pair it with what Joe is just talking about: these communities that are having as much fun as you are, right. Like NBA top shot, which was the first stuff I started buying. Which is a good case study, right? Like top shot is clearly better than trading baseball cards, right? Like it's just an improvement, you can watch them (basketball’s NBA GIF), you can look at them, there's some hype, you can get in the Discord. And there's a community that has developed around them like there have been communities around all kinds of collectibles from Pokemon to Comic-Con to you name it, but again, to make it digital and frictionless and, you know, anybody can kind of jump in and out without moving off their couch, that's mind-blowing.

Again, you know all about the provenance, you can put predictable ownership and royalties into them, you know, an actual piece of art or collectibles so that somebody can continue to get paid for it into the future.

So there's a company called POAP, Proof Of Attendance Protocol. I think you're airdropping them (the POAPs) for maybe attending this event or for some other thing. It's super cool to think that like over time you can just build up a little passport book of things you've attended and people can say: "Hey, I share interest with that person". You can get airdropped for doing certain things in a protocol, right? Like earn NFTs for doing X, Y, Z, like a dude has traded a hundred thousand dollars worth of Opensea NFTs, therefore he earns this NFT that we drop him and then marketers or other people who want to give him value as a super collector, identify him for a segment and can drop things to him.
