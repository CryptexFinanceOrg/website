Hello Everyone,

I recently wrote an intro into technical analysis for beginners, which you can find here - [TCAP Technical Analysis Intro Post](https://cryptex.finance/blog/2021-10-09-tcap-technical-analysis-intro-post/)

This post will be my first application of the info used in the article above on the total crypto market capitalization, represented in the form of $TCAP. The first token that encapsulates the entire crypto market under one synthetic & collateralized asset.

Find all the information on $TCAP and how you can use it as a tool for your benefit and as a hedge against your investment in singular assets here - [About Cryptex Finance](https://cryptex.finance/#about)

However, for this analysis, we will be using the TOTAL crypto market chart (Calculated by TradingView).

I am using TOTAL since the $TCAP chart has not matured enough to provide a complete picture of the market's history. Later on, as time progresses, we will switch our analysis to the $TCAP chart, as it allows us to make hypothetical investments and apply them to our study.

These articles will represent my thoughts and are in no way intended to be used as a recommendation or as financial advice. This is for educational and research purposes ONLY. I want to re-state that we will be adopting an agnostic/neutral view of the market. We will not be thinking about what we want/wish to happen but instead what we believe will most likely occur.

TA is simply deriving the events that we think have the highest probability of occurring, not predicting the future. Life can always throw us a curveball or two.

Let's start with the daily chart:

![](/img/29824cd2-f7c3-4af3-8949-2a9cb8643205.jpeg)

1. The recent up-trend has been above the 20 Day SMA since the beginning of October. We can see that the TCAP had stalled under the previous resistance represented by markers #3 and #5 (~$2.5T) before going on to make a new all-time high at just under $2.8T. It proceeded to dip to the support of the 20 Day SMA and continued to put in new higher daily lows. After the failure to pass the resistance of marker #3 at marker #5, the TCAP dipped to find support at the 200 Day SMA before the buyers took it up to re-test the high and finally pass it after about a week of fluctuation just under the resistance level to break it finally and put it a slightly higher high.
2. SMA's: During the first leg up from the low $1.2T in July, the new up-trend did not have SMA alignment (20, 50, 200). This suggests that while the buyers were gearing up for a new bull-run, the technicals were not entirely in place to take the price higher than the previous ATH. After a healthy dip which was supported by the 200 Day SMA, we see that the next leg up was supported with SMA alignment, which to me, indicates that this move is stronger than the previous one.

   A. MACD Crossover: We see that despite the MACD having a bearish cross, it is immediately curling up to put in another bullish cross in the short term.

   B. RSI: No longer in undersold level, the RSI is also curling up and looking to enter break-out mode, during which it goes into an undersold level but is not affected by this indicator until the break-out is over.

   C. On-Balance Volume: OBV is pointing upwards slightly, suggesting this upwards move will continue.

   **Final Thoughts:**

   The determination of the buyers is strong. Despite the resistance of the previous ATH creating big dips twice, after about six months of trying, the buyers were finally able to break this vast mental barrier. It is my opinion that the market is only at the beginning of a bull run because the new ATH only surpassed the previous one marginally. I believe the current support of around $2.4T will hold up in the short-term future, and the TCAP will go on to surpass the $2.8T level in the next leg up.

   The daily chart presents an uptrend that has been first supported by the 200 Day SMA and is now holding above the 20 Day SMA while continuously putting in higher lows, with SMA Alignment and all indicators curling upwards, suggesting a strong future upwards move.

   Weekly Chart:

   ![](/img/4a9a39d7-99b5-4073-90ab-5a2f129d6822.jpeg)

   1. The resistance line at the $2.58T line level at which the big May dip happened was retested, and after a slight drop at the beginning of September, the buyers went on to slightly peak over this level to put in a new ATH before dipping slightly. This suggested that there would be a more significant move above this ATH which occurred the week after as it almost reached the $2.8T level to put in a slightly more substantial ATH.
   2. The new ATH, while around $300M higher than the previous one, still is not a considerable increase over the past one. Considering the previous bull-run started around the $200B levels and went all the way up to the $2.58T level, and as an index, TCAP is not considered in a bull-run until it is in a new ATH and price discovery level, the current bull run's beginning is at the $2.6T level. While I do not expect another 10X like the previous run, I do believe this is only the beginning, and there is a considerable way to go in the upwards direction.
   3. SMAs: We have had SMA alignment since the beginning of the previous bull-run. The exception here is that now we have all SMA's pointing upwards again, suggesting the new leg-up will continue.
   4. Volume: We see much more buying volume than selling volume in the 14 weeks as only 3 of the 14 weeks saw more selling than buying.

   A. MACD Crossover is still in a bullish cross and pointing upwards.

   B. RSI is not in undersold territory yet suggesting much more room to move up, especially in a potential break-out.

   C. OBV is pointing upward sharply, suggesting the upwards move will continue with buyer conviction.

   **Final Thoughts:** The weekly chart suggests that the TCAP is in a long-term up-trend (Bull-run) which has only seen one significant pull-back (dip) while maintaining SMA alignment and a bullish overview for all indicators. I believe this suggests a much more pronounced second upwards move upon us. I do not see the up-trend ending here as the buyers pushed the price all the way back up from $1.2T level to $2.77T level, which to me is not a considerable gain enough for the buyers to be content with this move. Usually, a bull-run experiences 2 or 3 legs up and dips before seeing a complete overturn into a bear market. As TCAP is an index for the entire crypto market, it is not considered in a bull market unless it is putting in continuous ATH every candle. I believe we are at the beginning of the next big leg-up.

   Monthly chart:

   ![](/img/ed31ba38-187d-4791-a108-f3f039b193b7.jpeg)

   1. Looking at the monthly chart, we can observe the long-term bull run in a more easy-to-read visual. After a small bump, we saw the TCAP finally enter the mainstream worldwide view and break out to unprecedented levels. We see a significant pullback at the beginning of 2021, which was held up by the 20 Month SMA, and recovery to slightly past the previous ATH. Unless we see a break under the $1.75T level, this suggests we are in the second leg up of the long-term uptrend, which will see the TCAP put in a big move upwards, which I expect to surpass the $3T level.
   2. Considering there is no 200 Month SMA, we can see that this index and market as a whole are still in infancy levels when compared to other indexes such as the SPY or the NDX. We also do have an alignment for the 20 Month SMA & 50 Month SMA.
   3. Volume: We see considerable buying volume as we see only 4 of 16 months had more selling than buying, which suggests that the buyers are in complete control in the long-term.

   ![](/img/b2f186e1-1f34-479a-938d-4812cd13e681.jpeg)

   A, B, & C: We see a break-out for all indicators as they are all pointing upwards after a brief consolidation, suggesting that the long-term trend will continue in a strong up-trend.

   **Final Thoughts:** The monthly chart shows a clear up-trend which had only seen the first up-leg before a dip which did not drop below 50% of the up-trend. This is followed by price recovery and slight new ATH, which confirms our thoughts on the smaller time-frames that we are at the cusp of a new considerable upwards move.

   As mentioned above, as an index, TCAP is not considered in a bull market until it is putting in continuous ATH with every candle. As we have seen our first ATH this candle, unless we see a big break under the $1.75T level, we will see a big move up to surpass the $3T level and put us into price discovery mode before the next big dip.
