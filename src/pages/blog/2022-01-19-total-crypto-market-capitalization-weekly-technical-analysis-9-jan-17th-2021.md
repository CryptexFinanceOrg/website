Hello Everyone,

Welcome to the 9th edition of our weekly series, during which we perform technical analysis on the total crypto market capitalization (TCAP).

To familiarize yourself with the indicators and concepts we discuss here, [please refer to my intro post](https://cryptex.finance/blog/2021-10-09-tcap-technical-analysis-intro-post/), which is a detailed introduction/overview of technical analysis, and the indicators we will be using in these weekly posts. Also, you can find [last week's analysis here.](https://cryptex.finance/blog/2022-01-10-total-crypto-market-capitalization-weekly-technical-analysis-8-jan-9th-2022/)

The information we present here can be utilized for profit using $TCAP, the first synthetic & collateralized asset which encompasses the entire crypto market. Find all the info on $TCAP and how you can use it as a tool for your benefit and as a hedge against your investments in singular assets here - [About Cryptex Finance](https://cryptex.finance/#about)

However, for this analysis, we will be using the TOTAL crypto market chart (Calculated by TradingView). I am using TOTAL since the $TCAP chart has not matured enough to provide a complete picture of the market's history. Later on, as time progresses, we will switch our analysis to the $TCAP chart, as it allows us to make hypothetical investments and apply them to our study.

DISCLAIMER: These articles will represent my thoughts and are in no way intended to be used as a recommendation or as financial advice. This is for educational and research purposes ONLY. I want to re-state that we will be adopting an agnostic/neutral view of the market. We will not be thinking about what we want/wish to happen but instead what we believe will most likely occur.

TA is simply deriving the events that we think have the highest probability of occurring, not predicting the future. Life can always throw us a curveball or two. With that being said, let's get into this week's analysis:

## Daily Chart

**Analysis:** As we predicted last week, $2.1T Total Capitalization (TCAP) was a HARD POINT OF RESISTANCE. This week we’ve seen that the price attempted to cross this level 5 times, and got rejected 5 times. This confirms that this level indeed induced high selling pressure. We’re now seeing a breakdown in price. The next levels of support are $1.7T TCAP (weak) and $1.5T TCAP (strong). We should watch these levels and see the market reaction to be able to pinpoint an end to the downtrend. The end of the downtrend can only be confirmed when the price has put in a higher-high and higher-low than the previous to highs and lows, respectively.

### Daily Indicators

* **MACD:** Curling back down and looking to put in another bearish cross. Indicating price might continue lower.
* **RSI:** Pointing sharply downwards. Indicating price will move lower rapidly.
* **OBV:** Pointing slightly downwards. Indicating price will move lower.

## Weekly Chart

**Analysis:** Last week, we talked about a huge possible break in the long-term trend which saw the price dip slightly lower than the 50-week SMA (blue line) for the first time since May 2020. The week’s candle closed slightly above this support level but in the bottom half of the previous larger red candle, which indicates this candle represented selling consolidation. This current week’s candle has since dropped lower and is holding at the blue line support. If we see a significant drop and close to under the blue line, this will confirm a long/medium-term bear case and could see TCAP retrace to just over the 200-week SMA (red line) at the $700B level. The biggest support level before that would be the $1.5T to $1.2T range.

### Weekly Indicators

* **MACD:** Continuing bearish cross with no sign of curling back up. Indicating price will continue downwards on the weekly basis.
* **RSI:** Curling down which indicates price will continue lower. I believe this could be a classic undersold to oversold movement which would see the RSI drop to touch the bottom of the pink range which is the oversold level.
* **OBV:** Curling downwards indicating price will continue lower.

## Monthly Chart

**Analysis:** Monthly charts shows a clear indication of total capitalization topping off at the $3T level. Currently sitting at support on the $2T level. If we look at the history, we can see the price only recovered during the previous crash when it approached the 20-month SMA (yellow line). If history were to repeat itself, which it often does in the trading world, we can safely expect the price to rebound at or around the yellow line level of $1.5T in order to maintain an overall bullish overview of the market. A significant drop below the yellow line will see the price drop all the way to the 50-month SMA at $700B, which we also confirmed on the weekly chart to be the main point of support in a possible bear market.

### Monthly Indicators

* **MACD:** Huge break in trend which is seeing the MACD put in a bearish cross for the first time since May 2020. This is a clear indicator that something is happening which hasn’t happened for a long time. This is the main indication of a possible long-term bear market.
* **RSI:** Pointing sharply downwards with room to drop much lower. Indicating price will continue lower.
* **OBV:** Pointing downwards under all support. Indicating price will continue lower and has no close support levels.
