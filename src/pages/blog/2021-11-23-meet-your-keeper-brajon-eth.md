**What is your name?**

brajon.eth

**What is your background?**

Previous work includes manual labor (demo, paint, landscape), many other odd jobs, and being a financial professional, with education in portfolio management (specializing in Hedge Funds) from a top business school. I began coding in 2016 after leaving the finance industry and found web3 in late 2019. My main focus so far has been writing my own code for exotic transactions (liquidations, private relay, arbitrage, etc.), building out a stronger network of DAO involvement, and collecting NFTs (photography and generative are my favorite).

**What's your experience working with DAOs?**

I attended my first DAOfest in Denver in Feb 2020, right before ETH Denver. Both events were extremely influential in helping me understand what DAOs are, how they form & which important questions need to be answered when navigating a DAOs journey. By mid-2020 I spent most of my time interacting with Enzyme Finance & The LAO, by learning about their internal workings and ideating on ways I could contribute. I am an original member of Inverse Finance, which started around the same time I discovered Cryptex Finance. I built an open-sourced monitoring tool for Cryptex Vault Liquidations prior to TCAPs release ([](https://github.com/brajonn/TCAP_keeper)<https://github.com/brajonn/TCAP_keeper>), which some still may find handy if looking for a quick python solution. More recently I helped found Ready Player DAO along with some incredible people I have been fascinated with since the start of my DAO career.

**What about Cryptex excites you the most?**

Hands down it‚Äôs the team and their cohesion that makes me so excited about Cryptex. From the start Joe, Preston, Cris & Tom have all been incredibly helpful and open to discussing the idea behind Cryptex and have done a phenomenal job bringing in talented individuals to round out the rest of the internal group. I also think the way in which the community has organically assembled and become much more active & vocal is a strong sign of growing interest and‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre still early :)

**What is the future you see for Cryptex?**

My vision is one where Cryptex products (such as TCAP) are used for intelligent portfolio management, where investors have access to special markets that encapsulate a more broad strategy enabling a diversified and risk-adjusted approach. I think institutional money managers will appreciate the simplicity in which one can access a large portion of the market with one token and my goal is for Cryptex products to be used by every type of investor looking for crypto exposure, from the largest of pension funds to the newest market entrants.

**In your view, what are the most important developments that should be prioritized?**

Right now I think my biggest concern is the premium at which TCAP trades versus its minting price via the Chainlink oracle. It has been fairly constant since inception and because the arbitrage opportunity needs the premium to close towards fair value or become discounted in order to be profitable, it becomes a much more risky play. I think getting more liquidity in the TCAP vaults and subsequently into the TCAP/ETH LP, is a solution to this issue and that could come from incentivizing minting, adding new collateral to vaults, or a combination of the two. I posted about this in the governance forum, so please head to [forum.cryptex.finance](https://forum.cryptex.finance/) in order to further the discussion on this subject.

**Why should people choose you as their crypt keeper?**

I represent a lot of smaller CTX holders and take pride in having a voice for the ‚Äúlittle guy‚Äù. I will do my best to understand the communities ideas on how to further the success of the protocol and translate them into proposals and votes in the best interest of the DAO. I plan on being a crypt keeper for many years to come and truly believe that Cryptex Finance has an opportunity to capture an important share of the market for specialized trading tokens. Being close to the executive team, I feel comfortable bridging the communities questions or concerns that may arise and hope to become an integral cog in the wheel that is Cryptex.

**What is a hobby of yours?**

Surfing, making music & climbing mountains or tall structures. Looking at and making art is a lot of fun too. I like clubbing with my shirt off and shades on üòé
