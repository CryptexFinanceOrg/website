Cryptex (CTX) the protocol and community behind Total Crypto Market Cap token (TCAP), is constantly inspired and impressed with the creators and builders of web3. Cryptex created Space Invaders to help people get an inside look into the minds of the most important web3 creators and builders of our time. \*\*\*\*

On November 11th, 2021, Cryptex welcomed BFresh as host, and Leighton Cusak from Pool Together as the guest of the 10th episode of Space Invaders. Typically these episodes are recorded live on Twitter Spaces then published on YouTube and a variety of podcast platforms.

In this post, we are sharing the most thought-provoking and alpha-infused pieces of the conversation. These are things most people would not get a chance to find out unless they were listening to the conversation at air time, which you can find on our YouTube channel and podcast form.

Read on for the alpha leaks from Space Invaders Episode 10 with Leighton Cusak.

### On to the Alpha

**BFresh**: I like how Pool Together gamified itself and attracts the degen kind of people - but in a positive way.

**Leighton:** At the end of the day, Pool Together has some game-like elements, but it's not actually technically a lottery. I like to stay away from using that word just because of the prejudice attached to it though. But I think the thing is that most people in the world don't have enough money to make a meaningful return on their money. Right? So earning a 10% APR on a million dollars is great, but if you have a hundred dollars and you're earning $10 a year, that's not going to change your life.

People need the opportunities they get with dog tokens. They don't have the ability to lock it up for a long time, so I think what's foundational about Pool Together is it gives access to asymmetrical returns without needing to risk your capital.

**BFresh**: Obviously decentralized governance allows people to propose upgrades. How does the actual governance upgrade take place and what kind of upgrades can you do for Pool Together?

**Leighton**: Existing Pool token holders can decide to distribute undistributed Pool tokens. There are also protocol upgrades, and whether the protocol is going to be deployed on a new blockchain and what yield source is going to be introduced. But as a governance proposal, at the end of the day, is executable computer code.

We've had 30 or 40 governance proposals so far. And actually, I haven't even voted on any of them yet. I've never voted in any governance proposal nor submitted proposals. It's pretty awesome to have a truly community-run project.

**BFresh**: It's actually really cool to think of that - that the co-founder of the protocol hasn't even bought in. At first, it doesn't sound good, but then you realize "oh yeah, it's decentralized."

**Leighton**: Even that word co-founder is an outdated word. Like, that's a Web2 word that we've ported over into Web3, but protocols don't have co-founders. There are maybe early contributors, various things like that, but I don't think talking about protocol co-founders is really the right language for what we're doing with Web3.

Vitalik is less and less important to Ethereum every day. I'm less and less important to Pool Together every day. Robert Leshner is less and less important to Compound.

**BFresh**: I think one of the biggest topics for different protocols moving forward is how are they going to handle all the different chains and the fragmentation of liquidity?

**Leighton**: It will get better. I mean, Ethereum is going to be the base chain. It will be where millions of dollars get moved around. People aren't going to use Ethereum anymore. I tell people not to use it because it is too expensive - it's reached that point. Ethereum is where the money settles, then there will be the L2's that interact with and resolve to Ethereum. Ultimately, though, they offer cheap transactions.
