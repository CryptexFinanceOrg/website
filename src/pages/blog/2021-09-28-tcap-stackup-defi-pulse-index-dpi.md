Does the sheer number of different cryptocurrencies make your head spin? Or perhaps keeping track of the taxable events while rebalancing your portfolio and having to shell out for gas fees has you down? Enter crypto index tokens: offering broad crypto exposure, savings on gas fees, and automatic rebalancing - all to make your investing journey easier. However, as always in crypto, there's more than one option to choose from; let's dig into the popular [DeFi Pulse Index (DPI)](https://www.indexcoop.com/dpi) and Total Crypto Market Cap Token (TCAP) to see how they stack up.

## **StackUp Verdict**

DPI & TCAP each come with their own strengths to consider:

* Are you new to crypto and unsure which tokens to buy, but believe in the long-term growth of the crypto asset class and want broad exposure to it? - TCAP might be for you.
* Do you already have an established crypto portfolio and are just looking to specifically round out your DeFi exposure? - DPI could be a good option to consider.
* Or perhaps you've called the top of the bull market and you want to open up a short position? - Both DPI and TCAP's minting capabilities offer this to advanced users.

Certainly there are other considerations to keep in mind for your particular situation as well. But when you're evaluating index token options, whether they be DPI, TCAP or something else, keep these key considerations in the back of your mind.
