Between October 7th, 2021 (ETH/TCAP) and October 17th, 2021 (ETH/CTX) a total of 700,000 CTX will be unlocking from liquidity pool incentives established upon launch and are now available for continued staking.

Our DAO’s initial liquidity pool initiatives have been wildly successful by any metric, averaging triple digit APYs for anyone involved since the launch of the Cryptex DAO on April 7th, 2021, and the launch of CTX governance on April 17, 2021.

With that said, it’s an honor for our team to announce Single Side CTX Staking AND the EXTENSION of our existing ETH/TCAP and ETH/CTX LP’s, to the world.

* SINGLE SIDE STAKING NOW LIVE WITH 60,000 CTX ADDED TO THE POOL FOR STAKING, ZERO LOCKUP, 100% REWARDS PER BLOCK BASIS FOR 6 MONTHS, 7 DAY MINIMUM STAKING PERIOD. BEGINS THURSDAY OCTOBER 7TH.
* ETH/TCAP LP EXTENDED WITH 100,000 CTX ADDED TO THE POOL, 100% REWARDS PER BLOCK BASIS FOR 6 MONTHS, ZERO LOCKUP. BEGINS MONDAY OCTOBER 11TH.
* ETH/CTX LP EXTENDED WITH 100,000 CTX ADDED TO THE POOL, 100% REWARDS PER BLOCK BASIS FOR 6 MONTHS, ZERO LOCKUP. BEGINS SUNDAY OCTOBER 24TH.







1. In order to propose a vote, a minimum of 100,000 CTX is required.
2. In order to pass a vote, a minimum of 400,000 CTX is required.

With a minimum of 400,000 CTX staked to the new single side system, our community has the power to continue earning CTX rewards, the same time they can delegate voting to members of our community to pass the proposals needed for our DAO to continue to thrive.

We look forward to continuing this journey together.
