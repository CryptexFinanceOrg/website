Hello Everyone,

Welcome to the 7th edition of our weekly series, during which we perform technical analysis on the total crypto market capitalization (TCAP).

To familiarize yourself with the indicators and concepts we discuss here, [please refer to my intro post](https://cryptex.finance/blog/2021-10-09-tcap-technical-analysis-intro-post/), which is a detailed introduction/overview of technical analysis, and the indicators we will be using in these weekly posts. Also, you can find [last week's analysis here.](https://cryptex.finance/blog/2021-11-21-total-crypto-market-capitalization-weekly-technical-analysis-5-nov-21st-2021/)

The information we present here can be utilized for profit using $TCAP, the first synthetic & collateralized asset which encompasses the entire crypto market. Find all the info on $TCAP and how you can use it as a tool for your benefit and as a hedge against your investments in singular assets here - [About Cryptex Finance](https://cryptex.finance/#about)

However, for this analysis, we will be using the TOTAL crypto market chart (Calculated by TradingView). I am using TOTAL since the $TCAP chart has not matured enough to provide a complete picture of the market's history. Later on, as time progresses, we will switch our analysis to the $TCAP chart, as it allows us to make hypothetical investments and apply them to our study.

DISCLAIMER: These articles will represent my thoughts and are in no way intended to be used as a recommendation or as financial advice. This is for educational and research purposes ONLY. I want to re-state that we will be adopting an agnostic/neutral view of the market. We will not be thinking about what we want/wish to happen but instead what we believe will most likely occur.

TA is simply deriving the events that we think have the highest probability of occurring, not predicting the future. Life can always throw us a curveball or two. With that being said, let's get into this week's analysis:

### Daily Chart

**Analysis:** Possible ‘Head and Shoulders’ pattern emerging on the daily TCAP chart. The resistance levels are just below $2.5T. Should the price fluctuate under this level and continuously get rejected, a drop could complete the pattern in result in a further drop to test the 200 SMA.

However, if this resistance is broken and the TCAP goes back up to above the 50 SMA and between $2.6T and $2.8T levels, we can expect it to put in a new ATH at around the $3.2T level. It is unclear at this stage where the price is headed, but this $2.5T level will be vital in determining the long-term direction of the daily chart.

### Daily Indicators

![](/img/dec-27-daily-indicators-copy.jpg)

* **MACD:** Continuing bullish cross upwards, not looking to curl back down yet. Could indicate this short-term rally to continue.
* **RSI:** Looks to have crossed previous resistance and consolidated. I expect a classic oversold to undersold move here, so I see it continue to rise in the short-term along with the price.
* **OBV:** Steadily going sideways. Not much of an indicator here.

## Weekly Chart

**Analysis:** Again, here with the weekly chart, we are questioning the formation of a ‘Head and Shoulders’ pattern, and the reason being I believe this second drop is too low to be considered a second dip after the one in July, as both dips dropped to almost an identical place. There is still room to move upwards slightly before it hits the ~$2.5T level resistance and then either breaks up/down. That will ultimately be the key to the future of this chart.

### Weekly Indicators

* **MACD:** Continuing downwards after the bearish cross. Indicating price will continue downwards. However, it seems to be curling slightly up, so there could be short-term relief.
* **RSI:** Demonstrating a similar ‘Head and Shoulders’ look like the price chart. Pointing slightly upwards, indicating price could continue to recover.
* **OBV:** Pointing Sharply upwards indicates the price will recover upwards along with solid volume. The other indicators *could* be lagging behind here.

## Monthly Chart

![](/img/dec-27-monthly-chart-copy.jpg)

**Analysis:** The current month’s candlestick has an extended bottoming tail, indicating that it is more bullish than bearish despite being red. I expect next month to open in the green as there are few candlesticks without topping tails. This is supported by this month’s closing with such a prominent bottoming tail. However, it’s difficult for me to see an immediate price recovery and new ATH after this current month’s candle with the way it looks.

### **Monthly Indicators**

![](/img/dec-27-monthly-indicators-copy.jpg)

* **MACD:** Pointing slightly downwards towards a bearish cross. Nothing too clear-cut, though.
* **RSI:** Pointing sharply downward, indicating the price will continue to drop long-term.
* **OBV:** Pointing Sharply downwards and below support, in line with the RSI.

**Final Thoughts:** The TCAP looks to recover in the short term. $2.5T looks like the resistance level to watch. This is looking tougher and tougher to crack. If it holds, the price could drop long-term. If the price breaks this level, there is a good chance we will see a new ATH. At this moment, it is unclear where the price is headed 100%.
