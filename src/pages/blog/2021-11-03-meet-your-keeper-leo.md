description: Upon the launch of Single Side CTX Staking, Cryptex rolled out the
  Crypt Keeper delegator program. In an effort to further decentralize the
  protocol, users must select a delegator when staking. Crypt Keepers are
  responsible for actively viewing and participating in governance proposals.
  This is a big responsibility! We decided to host a series of interviews on
  each Crypt Keeper to help the community make informed decisions. This edition
  of our series features our Keeper Leo. We asked Leo a series of questions on
  their background, experience, and vision for Cryptex.

Upon the launch of Single Side CTX Staking, Cryptex rolled out the Crypt Keeper delegator program. In an effort to further decentralize the protocol, users must select a delegator when staking. Crypt Keepers are responsible for actively viewing and participating in governance proposals. This is a big responsibility! We decided to host a series of interviews on each Crypt Keeper to help the community make informed decisions. This edition of our series features our Keeper Leo. We asked Leo a series of questions on their background, experience, and vision for Cryptex.

**What is your background?**

* I am a software engineer building a layer one public blockchain.

**What's your experience working with DAOs?**

* I have participated in several DAOs focusing on NFT investment, and Defi products.

**What about Cryptex excites you the most?**

* I love the synthetic asset sectors. The S&P500 for all crypto market cap is so cool. Also, the fair launch is the key to bootstrap the community and supporters of the project. Thatâ€™s the key spirit of a blockchain project.

**What is the future you see for Cryptex?**

* I see Cryptex can expand to other synthetic assets not only on TCAP but also sectors like the DeFi sector, NFT sector, or even more like S&P500, NASDAQ, etc. Cryptex can be a strong protocol of all kinds of synthetic assets by working with the Chainlink oracle.

**In your view, what are the most important developments that should be prioritized?** 

* There are two things we need to consider. One is to increase the adoption of the TCAP product in the DeFi world, such as using it as collateral for lending protocol. Another one is to increase the TVL of Cryptex and the liquidity of TCAP.

**Why should people choose you as their crypt keeper?**

* First of all, I love this project and took part in it since the testnet. Second, I worked in the crypto industry for a few years so that I am very familiar with various crypto projects, including L1/L2, DeFi, and NFT. I would like to contribute my time and ideas to help grow and improve the project. Third, I have a strong connection with a large global Chinese crypto community, which provided me with a diversified view to help the project outreach to more community members.

**What is a hobby of yours?**

* I love long-distance running, and hiking/backpacking
