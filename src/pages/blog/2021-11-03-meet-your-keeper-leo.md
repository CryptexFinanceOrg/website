description: Upon the launch of Single Side CTX Staking, Cryptex rolled out the
  Crypt Keeper delegator program. In an effort to further decentralize the
  protocol, users must select a delegator when staking. Crypt Keepers are
  responsible for actively viewing and participating in governance proposals.
  This is a big responsibility! We decided to host a series of interviews on
  each Crypt Keeper to help the community make informed decisions. The first
  edition of this series features our Keeper Indigo. We asked Indigo a series of
  questions on their background, experience, and vision for Cryptex.

Upon the launch of Single Side CTX Staking, Cryptex rolled out the Crypt Keeper delegator program. In an effort to further decentralize the protocol, users must select a delegator when staking. Crypt Keepers are responsible for actively viewing and participating in governance proposals. This is a big responsibility! We decided to host a series of interviews on each Crypt Keeper to help the community make informed decisions. This edition of our series features our Keeper Indigo. We asked Indigo a series of questions on their background, experience, and vision for Cryptex.

**What is your background?**

I am a Security Engineer by trade at a top tech company. I'm also a huge crypto hobbyist and like to perform security audits of smart contracts and blockchain company OpSec for fun and profit. I love to learn about blockchains and DeFi in my free time and have been active in the space for almost a year now. I have been following Cryptex since its inception.

**What's your experience working with DAOs?**

Cryptex is the first project that I have seriously gotten involved with through a DAO. I've been active in other project communities but haven't been passionate about a DAO until Cryptex.

**What about Cryptex excites you the most?**

I love the talent and philosophy of the core team. What excites me most, though, is the idea of bringing an easily accessible crypto-index to the masses. I think a lot of people are more passive investors and just throw their savings into index funds. These are people that crypto misses, and TCAP makes it possible to passively invest in the whole space for people who know nothing about it.

**What is the future you see for Cryptex?**

It's hard to say what direction we will take. I expect to see TCAP become a major player in the token space because it is such a solid token that I think everyone can easily get behind. I believe people will invest in TCAP just as they have invested in the S&P 500, and Cryptex products will be a huge target for more passive investors that crypto generally has a hard time attracting.

**In your view, what are the most important developments that should be prioritized?** 

Expansion to L2 networks (Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, etc.), listing on more exchanges, and development of more oracle-pegged tokens. Expansion requires liquidity, so I feel it is really important to continue to incentivize liquidity providers and adopters of TCAP and CTX. I think we also need to reduce the barrier to entry of minting TCAP (decreasing minimum collateral requirements, utilizing locked collateral for yield farming opportunities, accepting more tokens as collateral).

**Why should people choose you as their crypt keeper?**

People should choose me if they feel strongly aligned with my core vision for Cryptex. I think it is healthier to distribute votes evenly among crypt keepers, though. Consider delegating to smaller crypt keepers so no one crypt keeper gets too big.

**What is a hobby of yours?**

I am an avid musician and love to learn to play new instruments. I mostly play piano and guitar and love to challenge myself with new music. I also like playing video games and have an extensive collection of mechanical keyboards. I like birbs. üê¶
