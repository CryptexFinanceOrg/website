**What is your name?**

DesertDwelr

**What is your background?**

I have a master's degree in Computer Engineering and over 20 years of experience in architecture and engineering of hardware and software solutions. I currently work as a Technical Product Manager for a Fortune 50 company, leading a team in providing custom software solutions to enterprise users.

**What's your experience working with DAOs?**

I just started getting involved in crypto projects in the last several months. I participate in governance on 2 other projects but they feel so much larger and less personal. The excitement and engagement of the Cryptex community and team are what motivated me to become a Crypt Keeper and I'm really looking forward to representing others in the DAO.

**What about Cryptex excites you the most?**

The future -- TCAP alone has huge potential but when you look beyond that to what else could be tokenized, the sky is truly the limit!

**What is the future you see for Cryptex?**

I see a robust ecosystem with a wide variety of DeFi products that, like TCAP, offer exposure to assets that aren't otherwise available or practical. I see a strong DAO with an ever-growing community of engaged and informed members and active governance that continues to advance and shape the DAO. I see a DeFi blue chip.

**In your view, what are the most important developments that should be prioritized?**

Continuing to incentivize liquidity providers and stakers. Enabling broader TCAP adoption. Making the protocol available on L2. Offering additional collateral options. Identifying the next asset(s) to be tokenized on the protocol.

**Why should people choose you as their crypt keeper?**

I am trustworthy and transparent. I am happy to discuss what I know, what I think, and what I don't know. I welcome input from those I represent. I feel that the DAO will be most healthy if the community spreads its delegation across a number of representatives, ideally from a variety of backgrounds and holding levels to ensure that all perspectives have a voice. I would be honored to be your voice!

**What is a hobby of yours?**

Spending time with my family, preferably doing something outdoors - hiking, swimming, fishing, live music, sports, or even just sitting around a firepit. I also consider learning a hobby. I try to continually grow myself - typically learning about new technologies but most recently trying to absorb all I can about cryptocurrency and decentralized finance from this great community as well as other online resources.

*Thank you for getting to know me and congratulations to those who decide to stake -- whether you choose me or someone else as your delegate, you're definitely going to make it!*
