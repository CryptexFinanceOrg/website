Welcome to the 4th edition of our weekly series, during which we perform technical analysis on the total crypto market capitalization (TCAP).

To familiarize yourself with the indicators and concepts we discuss here, [please refer to my intro post](https://cryptex.finance/blog/2021-10-09-tcap-technical-analysis-intro-post/), which is a detailed introduction/overview of technical analysis, and the indicators we will be using in these weekly posts. Also, you can find [last week's analysis here.](https://cryptex.finance/blog/2021-11-07-total-crypto-market-capitalization-weekly-technical-analysis-3-nov-7-2021/)

The information we present here can be utilized for profit using $TCAP, the first synthetic & collateralized asset which encompasses the entire crypto market. Find all the info on $TCAP and how you can use it as a tool for your benefit and as a hedge against your investments in singular assets here - [About Cryptex Finance](https://cryptex.finance/#about)

However, for this analysis, we will be using the TOTAL crypto market chart (Calculated by TradingView). I am using TOTAL since the $TCAP chart has not matured enough to provide a complete picture of the market's history. Later on, as time progresses, we will switch our analysis to the $TCAP chart, as it allows us to make hypothetical investments and apply them to our study.

DISCLAIMER: These articles will represent my thoughts and are in no way intended to be used as a recommendation or as financial advice. This is for educational and research purposes ONLY. I want to re-state that we will be adopting an agnostic/neutral view of the market. We will not be thinking about what we want/wish to happen but instead what we believe will most likely occur.

TA is simply deriving the events that we think have the highest probability of occurring, not predicting the future. Life can always throw us a curveball or two. With that being said, let's get into this week's analysis:

## Daily Chart:

**Analysis:** Honestly, looking at this chart - it's hard to figure out where the price is going from here at this exact point in time so I'm going to look at this a few different ways. First I'm going to look at what's happened in the past:

**Historical Analysis:**

1. We see the price forming this 'U' shaped wave starting at marker 1 and staying above the 20 Day SMA, until topping off with a large red candle with big topping & bottoming tails at marker #2.
2. After this violent #2 candle, the price consolidated and then dipped slightly below the yellow line before continuing up and forming another 'U' shaped wave to reach marker #3.
3. There the price topped off again with a large red candle with big topping & bottoming tails at marker #3, before dipping and consolidating.

If history were to repeat itself, which it often does, the price is about to dip slightly below the yellow line before continuing upwards.

### **Fibonacci Retracement/Extension Analysis:**

Since we haven't covered this before I am going to introduce you to the definition of Fibonacci levels:

**Definition:** Fibonacci Retracement/Extension are popular among technical traders. They are based on the key numbers identified by mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci in the 13th century. Fibonacci's sequence of numbers is not as important as the mathematical relationships, expressed as ratios, between the numbers in the series.

In technical analysis, a Fibonacci retracement is created by taking two extreme points (usually a peak and trough) on a chart and dividing the vertical distance by the key Fibonacci ratios of 23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, and 100%.

Once these levels are identified, horizontal lines are drawn and used to identify possible support and resistance levels.

We see that the chart topped off at the $3T level which we predicted would be a point of resistance in last week's analysis due to the psychological effect of whole numbers. Now the price is stuck between two levels of $2.8T and $2.7T. It looks like the price could either A. dip to the $2.6T level or B. Go back up to the $3T level.

* A. If it dips to the $2.7T level, we would be looking for a recovery back upwards as the last big dip saw the price only dip one level lower.
* B. If the TCAP recovers to $3T, we will be looking for it to exceed this level and put in a new ATH around the $3.2T level.

## Daily Indicators:

![](/img/cryptocap-indicators.jpeg "Cryptocap daily indicators 11/15/21")

* MACD: Bearing cross on the MACD.
* RSI: Topped off at around last time's resistance level and pointing downwards.
* OBV: Pointing Sharply Downwards.

**Thoughts:** It looks like we're at a point where there could be a dip, but not at the point where the long term uptrend is broken. Unless key support is broken at the $2.4T level, then we could expect the price to go upward again. The key levels to look at are at $3T, $2.6T, & $2.4T

## Weekly Chart:

![](/img/weekly-chart.jpeg "Cryptocap weekly chart 11/15/21")

**Analysis**: Looking back, I see that every time the pumped significantly, it rose around $1T before it dipped. Then it would dip around $500M - $700M. It seems like during this move up the TCAP has grown over $1T. It seems again if history were to repeat itself it's in for another dip of around $300M - $500M. It seems as we expected in the Daily chart above and looking at the Fibonacci levels, the price will dip to around the $2.4-$2.6T levels.

## Weekly Indicators:

* MACD: Still pointing upwards after bullish cross continuation. Looking a bit extended in its direction though and could be facing a dip soon.
* RSI: Facing resistance at the undersold level.
* OBV: Still pointing strongly upwards and past resistance. This tells us the past few days have seen higher than usual volume.

## Monthly Chart:

**Analysis:** It's amazing the way whole numbers present psychological barriers in people's minds as demonstrated by this chart where the past two candles started almost exactly at $2T and topped off exactly at $3T TCAP. We can see all the key support points especially the previous ATH's are between the $2.4T and $2.6T levels.

We are expecting the price to dip since it has already increased over $1T since the bottom of the last dip, and we will be watching the key support levels to look for either a bounce to retrace back up to the $3T ATH and surpass it, or a break under could mean the break in the long-term bull market.

## Monthly Indicators & Final Thoughts:

![](/img/monthly-indicators.jpeg "Monthly cryptocap Indicators")

All monthly indicators are still pointing firmly up which is in line with our long-term view that the price will increase. However, Because the TCAP has already grown by over $1T during this move, in the short term we are expecting a dip of around $400M to $600M to around $2.4-$2.6T TCAP before the next leg up. These levels previously represented the ATH and it took a lot of buying pressure to surpass them. Since then it's been apparent that the bulls are in control. A break under these levels could reverse the long-term uptrend we have been seeing.
