Hello Everyone,

Welcome to the 6th edition of our weekly series, during which we perform technical analysis on the total crypto market capitalization (TCAP).

To familiarize yourself with the indicators and concepts we discuss here, [please refer to my intro post](https://cryptex.finance/blog/2021-10-09-tcap-technical-analysis-intro-post/), which is a detailed introduction/overview of technical analysis, and the indicators we will be using in these weekly posts. Also, you can find [last week's analysis here.](https://cryptex.finance/blog/2021-11-21-total-crypto-market-capitalization-weekly-technical-analysis-5-nov-21st-2021/)

The information we present here can be utilized for profit using $TCAP, the first synthetic & collateralized asset which encompasses the entire crypto market. Find all the info on $TCAP and how you can use it as a tool for your benefit and as a hedge against your investments in singular assets here - [About Cryptex Finance](https://cryptex.finance/#about)

However, for this analysis, we will be using the TOTAL crypto market chart (Calculated by TradingView). I am using TOTAL since the $TCAP chart has not matured enough to provide a complete picture of the market's history. Later on, as time progresses, we will switch our analysis to the $TCAP chart, as it allows us to make hypothetical investments and apply them to our study.

DISCLAIMER: These articles will represent my thoughts and are in no way intended to be used as a recommendation or as financial advice. This is for educational and research purposes ONLY. I want to re-state that we will be adopting an agnostic/neutral view of the market. We will not be thinking about what we want/wish to happen but instead what we believe will most likely occur.

TA is simply deriving the events that we think have the highest probability of occurring, not predicting the future. Life can always throw us a curveball or two. With that being said, let's get into this week's analysis:

## Daily Chart:

**Analysis:** The TCAP has put in continuous lower highs and lower lows for the past few weeks. Consolidation in the bottom half of the drop from ~$2.7T to $2.1T is indicative that there will be another drop in the future. Unless there is a significant break in the trend where the price moves up and puts in a new higher high, it seems that the TCAP is heading to test the $2T level again which also happens to be the 200 Day SMA. This level will be a key support and will play a huge role in how the determining the health of the total market and what direction it is headed from there.

### Daily Indicators

MACD: looks like it is about to put in a bullish cross unless it bounces down off the red line. This indicates that there is a reversal in the downtrend coming. It could be substantial, or a minor bounce.

* RSI: Pointing sharply downwards indicating that the price will continue lower.
* OBV: Sideways movement, indicating that the consolidation will continue.

## Weekly Chart:

* MACD: Continuing downward after bearish cross without looking like curling back up yet. Indicating downwards consolidation will continue.
* RSI: Pointing downwards indicating price will continue to go lower.
* OBV: Pointing downwards and has not recovered to previous highs.

## Monthly Chart:

**Analysis:** With 18 days left on this last monthly candle and considering the range of this candle already, it seems unlikely for the TCAP to recover to over the ~$2.7T level for the rest of this month. We can expect resistance to be around the $2.4T level and support at the $2T level. We have to continue to watch this consolidation for a sharp move to understand the long term direction of the trend.

### Monthly Indicators:

* MACD: Heading downwards towards bearish cross. Indicating price will continue to go lower.
* RSI: Heading sharply down. Indicating price will continue to drop.
* OBV: Broke below support and is heading sharply downwards. Indicating price might drop sharply.

**Final Thoughts:** The market looks to continue it's slump in between the $2.4 to $1.9T range. We will need to see a big move in either direction to determine whether this is a long term bear market or a short term slump before more eventual growth. I do not expect the direction of the market to be completely decided this month, so I expect the price to continue in consolidation and perhaps make a more clear move in more than two weeks.
