On Thursday, October 28th, 2021, Kevin from the Chainlink team welcomed Cris to the Chainlink Telegram to host an AMA about Cryptex. Cris shared his backstory, details on Cryptex's relationship with Chainlink, and some alpha! Here is the full conversation:

**Kevin**: Good morning, everyone, I want to welcome @crisgarner of Cryptex Finance today. Cris, welcome to the Chainlink Official Telegram.  Thank you so much for sharing your time for a Community Q&A.

**Cris**: Hello everyone!

**Kevin**: Before we jump into things, can you tell us a little about yourself, your background, and your role at Cryptex Finance?

**Cris**: Sure, I studied computer science and graduated ~11 years ago. I always wanted to do my own startup but took the wrong decision of launching a fintech company. I hated it but learned a little about bitcoin, that was around 2014. Then I took a break, and in 2018 got back into blockchain development. That is when I found Ethereum. Since then, I have been learning and building a lot of stuff. I think hackathons were an important part of my growth as they allowed me to learn, experiment, and survive. Then in 2020, I started working with Cryptex full time as a Smart Contract Developer. I'm in charge of everything related to the smart contracts of the protocol.

**Kevin**: That's awesome.  What a journey!  Can you tell us a little bit about Cryptex Finance and the kinds of smart contracts the platform features?

**Cris**: Sure! Cryptex Finance is a decentralized protocol that builds products like indexes that any user has access to. TCAP is our flagship product and is a collateralized synthetic asset that tracks the Total Cryptocurrency Market Cap price. For example, If the market cap is 3 Trillion USD, TCAP is ~$300, so users can use it to diversify their positions. One of the reasons why I'm excited about this project is that if you are from the US you already have access to all of these products. But, if you are from a developing country your only financial possibility is depositing in a bank and waiting. DeFi and our products allow people to reach any financial tool that they need. The contract works similar to Maker, you create a vault, deposit collateral and then you take a debt in the form of TCAP. You are able to do whatever you want with TCAP and if you want to close your position you only pay back the TCAP and are returned your collateral. We also charge a small burn fee of 1% that goes to the DAO.

**Kevin**: Tremendous.  The TCAP token essentially serves at the S&P-type index function for the cryptocurrency space.  Can you tell us how Chainlink supports this function?

**Cris**: Right now we use Chainlink Price feeds as our main component. The first one is to get the price of the Total Crypto Market Cap. The second is to get the USD price of the assets we accept as collateral. Then we use some formulas that allow us to calculate how much TCAP can be minted as we require everything to be over collateralized. We plan to create some arbitrage bots to liquidate faulty vaults and might use Chainlink Keepers for that!

**Kevin**: We love to hear that! It is great to see the evolution and maturity of projects and platforms like yours, and as they grow, there are more possibilities to grow and incorporate more of Chainlink's products and services.

**Cris**: Yeah, something that accelerated our development was the use of Chainlink. At inception, we were planning on building our own oracles. We saved months of work in a more secure and decentralized way by using Chainlink.

**Kevin**: Right now, Chainlink is hosting the Fall Hackathon, and you mentioned that Hackathons were critical to your own development.  I was wondering if you could share a little bit about the experience to encourage someone watching today.

**Cris**: Yeah, I entered in a bear market, so almost no one was hiring at the time. When no one is hiring, it's the perfect time to build your own products. Hackathons allow you to explore new products while earning some money and meeting some people. Talking with sponsors can help. I remember going to every booth and asking some questions. I then picked which bounties I wanted to tackle. Now it's easier to participate in hackathons as most are virtual. The advantage of physical events is they allow you to connect with people. I was working on creating a collateralized coffee platform in hackathons giving free bags of coffee or selling them. That's how I met Preston, which lead me to work in Cryptex a year later.

**Kevin**: That's awesome.  Thank you for sharing.  Cryptex is a really interesting platform, and the TCAP token and index-type tokens are a real necessity for the blockchain space as it mirrors some of the features already present in traditional finance.  And Chainlink plays a critical role in its architecture.  Can you tell us what might be next on the roadmap for Cryptex Finance?  Any exciting developments on the horizon?

**Cris**: We are planning on building more products like TCAP. We are upgrading our vault systems to be more capital efficient, and of course launching on some L2 solutions. We want our products in the hands of more people in an accessible way. Our low-hanging fruit is that we are about to add more collateral options into our protocol. LINK is one of the options being discussed right now. We would love to know the marine's thoughts about it on our forum - [](https://forum.cryptex.finance/t/which-assets-should-be-added-as-vault-collateral/203)<https://forum.cryptex.finance/t/which-assets-should-be-added-as-vault-collateral/203>

**Kevin**: This is awesome.  To recap: Cryptex Finance uses Chainlink to support its Smart Contract architecture, where the price feeds support the TCAP token as well as to ensure the vaults are appropriately collateralized.  Cryptex Finance may soon be incorporating Chainlink Keepers, and the LINK token may soon be available as a source of collateral.  Is that all correct?

**Cris**: Yes.

**Kevin**: This is tremendous.  I love the variety of use cases employed here. Index tools are great sources of information in the traditional financial world.  Products like the Dow Jones and S&P provide a lot of data and are good tools to indicate the overall health of certain economic sectors.  Cryptex Finance brings these tools to life in a decentralized way for the cryptocurrency world, and they do it by integrating with Chainlink in numerous ways. I want to thank Cris for joining us today, and I want to thank Cryptex Finance for integrating with Chainlink for price feeds, Keepers, and for potentially offering the LINK token as a source of collateral. I want to encourage everyone to join the Cryptex Finance Discord and Telegram, and please participate in their governance forum and use these democratic tools so your voice is heard on their platform!

**Cris**: Thanks everyone, and thanks for the opportunity to talk about Cryptex!

**Kevin**: Thank you so much for your time today!  It was an absolute pleasure to learn more about your platform and your upcoming roadmap!

Thanks for reading everyone! Be sure to stay tuned for what's next with Cryptex and Chainlink!
