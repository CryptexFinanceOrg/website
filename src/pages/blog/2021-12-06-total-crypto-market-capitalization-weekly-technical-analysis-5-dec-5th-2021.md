Hello Everyone,

Welcome to the 5th edition of our weekly series, during which we perform technical analysis on the total crypto market capitalization (TCAP).

To familiarize yourself with the indicators and concepts we discuss here, [please refer to my intro post](https://cryptex.finance/blog/2021-10-09-tcap-technical-analysis-intro-post/), which is a detailed introduction/overview of technical analysis, and the indicators we will be using in these weekly posts. Also, you can find [last week's analysis here.](https://cryptex.finance/blog/2021-11-15-total-crypto-market-capitalization-weekly-technical-analysis-4-nov-14th-2021/)

The information we present here can be utilized for profit using $TCAP, the first synthetic & collateralized asset which encompasses the entire crypto market. Find all the info on $TCAP and how you can use it as a tool for your benefit and as a hedge against your investments in singular assets here - [About Cryptex Finance](https://cryptex.finance/#about)

However, for this analysis, we will be using the TOTAL crypto market chart (Calculated by TradingView). I am using TOTAL since the $TCAP chart has not matured enough to provide a complete picture of the market's history. Later on, as time progresses, we will switch our analysis to the $TCAP chart, as it allows us to make hypothetical investments and apply them to our study.

DISCLAIMER: These articles will represent my thoughts and are in no way intended to be used as a recommendation or as financial advice. This is for educational and research purposes ONLY. I want to re-state that we will be adopting an agnostic/neutral view of the market. We will not be thinking about what we want/wish to happen but instead what we believe will most likely occur.

TA is simply deriving the events that we think have the highest probability of occurring, not predicting the future. Life can always throw us a curveball or two. With that being said, let's get into this week's analysis:

## Daily Chart

**Analysis:** We will be breaking down the chart according to the last 3 dips because there are only 3 instances (so far) where the total market capitalization (TCAP) has dropped under the 200 Day SMA.

* Dip #1:

  * A. PRICE: TCAP dropped from \~$2.6T to the \~1.2T level. Total $ loss = $1.4T.
  * B. VOLUME: We see the highest volume during this dip.
* Dip #2:

  * A. PRICE: TCAP dropped from \~$2.5T to the \~1.75T level. Total $ loss = $0.75T.
  * VOLUME: Interesting to note lower buying and selling volume during this overall move than the previous one.
* Dip #3:

  * A. PRICE: TCAP dropped from \~$3T to the \~1.9T level. Total $ loss = $1.1T.
  * B. VOLUME: Also interesting to note here that the day of the big sellof had lower volume than Dip #2, yet resulted in a bigger drop.
  * CONCLUSION: This indicates lower buying pressure/less buyer conviction than the last dip as opposed to higher seller conviction. It is possible that buyers are more timid at these levels and could be waiting for a lower price to get in. The last two times the TCAP dropped below the 200 Day SMA we saw a few days of consolidation in the lower half of the total drop for a few days before the price took a direction either back under the 200 Day SMA or back over it. Thus, we can expect consolidation in the $2T - $2.3T range for the next few days with low buying pressure.

### Daily Indicators

* MACD: Bearish Cross and headed downwards, indicating downward move will continue.
* RSI: Broke downwards and headed in a downwards direction.
* OBV: Also pointing downwards, indicating the same as the other two.

## Weekly Chart

![](/img/dec-wk-1-weekly-chart.jpg "DEC wk 1 weekly chart")

**Analysis:** When we condense the price into a weekly chart we see that the latest dip (dip #3) is more similar to dip #1 than it is to dip #2, as they both dropped under the 20 Week SMA to touch the 50 Week SMA. Looking at the volume of these 3 moves, we see that dip #3 has the lowest levels of selling volume, yet had a bigger drop than dip #2. This, similar to what we deduced from the daily chart, indicates lower buying conviction/pressure than the previous dip. I can deduce that the TCAP will most likely consolidate downwards from the $2.3T level to the $1.9T level. The overall bullish view would be that TCAP would put in a higher low than dip #1 and stay above the 50 Week SMA, then bounce upwards to put in a new new hugh in an upwards in a rising wedge pattern.

The bearish view on the other hand would see the price drop to under the 50 Week SMA and back to the 200 Week SMA. It seems that we are in a short term - medium term bear market while the TCAP squeezes closer either higher or lower down the line.

### Weekly Indicators

![](/img/dec-2021-wk-1-weekly-indicators.jpg "DEC 2021 wk 1 weekly indicators")

* MACD: Bearish cross and headed downwards. Indicating that on the weekly level the price will continue downward.
* RSI & OBV: Pretty much the same deduction from the MACD.

## Monthly Chart

![](/img/dec-2021-wk-1-monthly-chart.jpg "DEC 2021 wk 1 monthly chart")

**Analysis:** To me, it looks obvious from this chart that the TCAP has topped off at the $3T level and will consolidate lower and look to bounce on support in the \~$1.75T - \~1.5T range. We see the huge topping tail on the previous month's candle, and that this month continued lower, and while it has bounced from the bottom, still shows no signs of rebounding to a new high, yet.

Here is what the above example of a rising wedge we drew on the weekly chart looks like on the monthly chart:

### Monthly Indicators

![](/img/dec-2021-wk-1-monthly-indicators-2.jpg "DEC 2021 wk 1 monthly indicators 2")

* MACD: Heading lower, not looking to cross yet, but still indicating the price will move lower.
* RSI: Dropped below under-sold range and looks to cool off before next move upwards.
* OBV: Broke under prevvious support and headed downwards.

**Overall Conclusions:** The TCAP looks like it's topped off and put in a new higher high than the previous bull run. I believe we can deduce that we are now witnessing the next big drop in price that could move TCAP lower towards ~$1.5T - $1.9T level. We will wait to make our deductions on what happens after that when it happens.

## Crypto Volatility Index:

CVI: I decided to include the CVI in this weeks analysis to show that despite singular assets fluctuating massively in the past few weeks, you can see that the total market remains much less volatile than before. This indicates market maturity and the safety of $TCAP as an investment. The CVI looks to move higher and I will follow it's movements in the next analysis.
