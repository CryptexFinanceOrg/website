Welcome to the second edition of our weekly series, during which we perform technical analysis on the total crypto market capitalization (TCAP).

To familiarize yourself with the indicators and concepts we discuss here, [please refer to my intro post](https://cryptex.finance/blog/2021-10-09-tcap-technical-analysis-intro-post/), which is a detailed introduction/overview of technical analysis, and the indicators we will be using in these weekly posts. Also, you can find [last week's analysis here](https://cryptex.finance/blog/2021-10-25-total-crypto-market-capitalization-weekly-technical-analysis-1-oct-23rd-2021/).

The information we present here can be utilized for profit using $TCAP, the first synthetic & collateralized asset which encompasses the entire crypto market. Find all the info on $TCAP and how you can use it as a tool for your benefit and as a hedge against your investments in singular assets here - [About Cryptex Finance](https://cryptex.finance/#about)

However, for this analysis, we will be using the TOTAL crypto market chart (Calculated by TradingView). I am using TOTAL since the $TCAP chart has not matured enough to provide a complete picture of the market's history. Later on, as time progresses, we will switch our analysis to the $TCAP chart, as it allows us to make hypothetical investments and apply them to our study.

DISCLAIMER: These articles will represent my thoughts and are in no way intended to be used as a recommendation or as financial advice. This is for educational and research purposes ONLY. I want to re-state that we will be adopting an agnostic/neutral view of the market. We will not be thinking about what we want/wish to happen but instead what we believe will most likely occur.

TA is simply deriving the events that we think have the highest probability of occurring, not predicting the future. Life can always throw us a curveball or two. With that being said, let's get into this week's analysis:

## **Daily Chart:**

![TCAP Daily Chart Oct 31](/img/1.jpeg)

**Analysis:** After passing the previous all-time high (ATH), we see a new resistance forming at marker #1 at ~$2.7T TCAP. This is typical after surpassing a long-lasting ATH. Although confidence is high, safer traders/investors prefer to sell at this point because they are satisfied with the gains they have made and consider it to be a 'safe bet' to sell here at a new, slightly higher ATH. 

We see that the 20 Day SMA (represented by the yellow line at marker #2) has held up since the market tested the previous ATH and dipped to the 200 Day SMA support (red line). Although we saw a slight dip under it in October, the price rebounded and traded between a price channel of the top resistance (\~$2.7T) and the bottom support (\~$2.5T). 

The volume (marker #4) suggests more selling than buying as 10 out of the last 16 volume bars have closed red. The 50 Day SMA (Marker #3, ~$2.3T) has yet to be thoroughly tested during this leg-up, keeping in mind that this crucial support line was tested four times during the run-up of the previous bull market.



**Thoughts:** Due to high selling pressure, mainly due to taking profits after surpassing the previous ATH, we could see a dip that tests the 50 Day SMA (Marker #3, ~2.3T) before the next leg up to finally substantially surpass the previous ATH and potentially touch the $3T level.

### **Daily Indicators:**

![TCAP Daily Indicators Oct 31](/img/tcap-daily-indicators-oct-31.jpeg)

* MACD: We see the MACD making a bearish cross and pointing downwards suggesting that a dip could be coming.
* RSI: RSI putting in somewhat of a double-top and pointing downward indicating a further downwards move.
* OBV: Pointing downward, in cohesion with the rest of the indicators. Buying volume is lower in the past few days.

## **Weekly Chart:**

![TCAP Weekly Chart Oct 31](/img/tcap-weekly-chart-oct-31.jpeg)

**Analysis:** After the famous dip, which saw the TCAP drop from the ATH of ~2.57T down to test the 50 week SMA (blue line), we see the price bounce off at marker #1 and put in a V-shaped almost total recovery to retest the previous ATH at marker #2. 

After the first round of profit-taking, we saw a slight dip to test the 20 Week SMA (yellow line) before the next leg up, which saw the TCAP surpass the previous ATH to set a new one at marker #3 (~$2.8T). This next round of profit-taking, which was more evident in the daily chart, suggests we are about to experience the next dip. We could see the price back to the previous support level, which in the daily chart was the 20 Day SMA. That is represented by the blue horizontal line (marker #4) which I have added.



**Thoughts:** At the blue horizontal support line, if the price rebounds to put in a new ATH, it will represent a higher high and a new higher low for this current cycle. As the TCAP is an index similar to the SPY or NDX, it is only considered in a bull market when it is constantly putting in ATH's.

The last leg up, which topped off at $2.57T and dipped to $1.8T, would be the theoretical kick-starter of the current bull cycle, and the subsequent move to ~$2.8T ATH, and the expected dip to around $2.2T will be the first official move of the bull market. I expect the next move after the $2.2T dip to see the TCAP test the $3T market cap next.

### **Weekly Indicators:**

![TCAP Weekly Indicators Oct 31](/img/tcap-weekly-indicators-oct-31.jpeg)

* MACD: Continuing the upwards move after the Bullish cross it put in around July, not having surpassed the level of the previous MACD high, despite the price having put in a new ATH, suggesting this overall move still has room to move upwards.
* RSI: Pointing slightly upwards, but as we can see approaching a resistance level when about to reach undersold level. RSI could point downwards from here.
* OBV: Also pointing upwards, but approaching the same previous resistance level which could see a slight dip downwards and some selling volume.

## Monthly Chart:

![TCAP Monthly Chart Oct 31](/img/tcap-monthly-chart-oct-31.jpeg)

**Analysis:** The month is about to close with a solid green candle close to the new ATH at marker #1 ($2.75T) after surpassing the previous ATH at marker #2 ($2.57T). This strong close suggests the upwards move will continue into next month. 

However, because we are expecting a dip after this round of profit-taking, which we derived from the daily and weekly charts, I expect the next month's candlestick to start in the red with a dip to around marker #3 (between the $2.15T and $2.25T levels). When looking at volume at marker #4, we see that 3 of the past 4 months have closed with green volume bars, suggesting buyers are in control.



**Thoughts:** I expect the next monthly candle to open in the red and drop to ~$2.2T level. I expect this dip to be followed by a rebound where the candle goes from red to green with a bottoming tail and a new ATH at the $3T level, which would be a new and much more significant ATH than the $2.8T level.

### **Monthly Indicators:**

![TCAP Monthly Indicators Oct 31](/img/tcap-monthly-indicators-oct-31.jpeg)

* MACD: Pointing upwards and heading into breakout mode which aligns with our expectation of a new significant ATH in the future.
* RSI: Pointing upwards after barely dropping out of undersold level and looks to enter breakout mode and surpass the previous RSI high until the bull-cycle ends.
* OBV: Pointing upwards in a pattern that is similar to an ascending triangle pattern, I expect the volume to break out of this level and put in a new high above the previous ATH.

## **Crypto Volatility Index**

*(Source: [cvi.finance](https://cvi.finance/))*

Looking at the Crypto Volatility Index, we see that the three highest spikes in volatility were during March 2020, Jan 2021, & May 2021.

Now, let us try to visualize these dates on a TCAP line & candlestick chart:

![TCAP CVI Line Chart Oct 31](/img/tcap-cvi-line-chart-oct-31.jpeg)

![TCAP CVI Candlestick Chart Oct 31](/img/tcap-cvi-candlestick-chart-oct-31.jpeg)

**Analysis:** Judging from these two charts, we can deduce that the 3 points during which volatility was the highest represent: 

1. A dip in March 2020, which in turn looks like it initiated significant accumulation, led to the TCAP explosion in point.
2. Jan 2021, where after a brief dip, we saw the most significant growth in the crypto market in history before reaching point 3. 
3. The bear market of May 2021 also saw a capitulation of the TCAP, during which it dropped by more than half its total value.

**Thoughts:** The interesting thing is, despite a v-shaped recovery and a new ATH, we see low volatility in the CVI. I am going to assume that money is flowing steadily into the market. Because we haven't seen significant volatility yet, this could mean that the market is still anticipating a large move and is still accumulating with low volatility. 

I would love to hear your interpretation of the volatility index since this is the first time I have analyzed this chart and compared it to the total crypto market cap.
