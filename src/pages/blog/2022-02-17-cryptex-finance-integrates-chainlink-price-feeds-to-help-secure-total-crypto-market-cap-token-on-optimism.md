We’re excited to announce that [Cryptex Finance](https://cryptex.finance/)—an open-source financial instrument for the global crypto community—has integrated [Chainlink Price Feeds](https://data.chain.link/) on Optimism mainnet. By integrating the industry-leading decentralized oracle network, Cryptex Finance has access to high-quality, tamper-proof price feeds needed to help secure the minting of TCAP, a token tracking the total crypto market capitalization. This will provide our users with stronger assurances that TCAP is always referencing high-quality price data.

Our initial integration involves the use of the [Total Marketcap/USD](https://docs.chain.link/docs/optimism-price-feeds/) Chainlink Price Feed on Optimism. We chose Chainlink as our go-to oracle solution because its infrastructure is seamless to integrate and time-tested in production. Chainlink already helps secure leading [DeFi](https://chain.link/education/defi) protocols responsible for tens of billions of dollars in smart contract value, maintaining robust security and high availability even amidst unexpected events, such as exchange downtime, flash crashes, and [data manipulation attacks via flash loans](https://blog.chain.link/flash-loans-and-the-importance-of-tamper-proof-oracles/). 

Cryptex Finance gives users real-time price exposure to the entire cryptocurrency sector in a single solution, known as TCAP. The entire market, yours at the push of a button. 

TCAP is not a fixed basket of tokens. TCAP is not an ICO, nor a rebasing elastic supply token. TCAP is a fully decentralized, 150% collateralized asset that’s both audited and accurately represents the entire cryptocurrency sector by total market capitalization. 

In order to help secure our total crypto market cap token, TCAP, we needed access to fresh asset prices that are supplied directly on-chain in a highly reliable manner. Fair market asset prices should reflect a volume-weighted average from all trading environments. Thus, we needed to make use of an [oracle network](https://chain.link/education/blockchain-oracles) to fetch aggregated price data off-chain and deliver it on-chain to be consumed by our application.

After reviewing various oracle solutions, we integrated Chainlink Price Feeds because they provide a multitude of critical features such as:

* High-Quality Data — Chainlink Price Feeds source data from numerous premium data aggregators, leading to price data that’s aggregated from hundreds of exchanges, weighted by volume, and cleaned of outliers and wash trading. Chainlink’s data aggregation model generates more precise global market prices that are inherently resistant to inaccuracies or manipulation of any single or small set of exchanges. 
* Secure Node Operators — Chainlink Price Feeds are secured by independent, security-reviewed, and Sybil-resistant oracle nodes run by leading blockchain DevOps teams, data providers, and traditional enterprises. Chainlink nodes have a strong track record of reliability, even during high gas prices and infrastructure outages. 
* Decentralized Network — Chainlink Price Feeds are decentralized at the data source, oracle node, and oracle network levels, generating strong protections against downtime and tampering by either the data provider or oracle network.
* Reputation System — Chainlink provides a robust reputation framework and set of on-chain monitoring tools that allow users to independently verify the historical and real-time performance of node operators and oracle networks.

“Starting with Optimism, Cryptex is beyond excited to announce the deployment of multiple layer-2 network and sidechain integrations. On a cumulative basis, these networks represent billions of dollars in total value locked (TVL), now accessible to TCAP and the Cryptex ecosystem. Layer-2 networks provide users with lightning-fast transaction speeds, tx costs at a fraction of that of L1s, and the ability to mint TCAP, the Total Crypto Market Cap Token supported by the industry-standard security and tamper-resistance of Chainlink price oracles.” — Joe Sticco, Co-Founder
