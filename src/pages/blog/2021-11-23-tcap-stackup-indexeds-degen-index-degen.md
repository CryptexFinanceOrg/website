Does the sheer number of different cryptocurrencies make your head spin? Or perhaps keeping track of the taxable events while rebalancing your portfolio and having to shell out for gas fees has you down? Enter crypto index tokens: offering broad crypto exposure, savings on gas fees, and automatic rebalancing - all to make your investing journey easier. However, as always in crypto, there's more than one option to choose from; let's dig into the [DEGEN Index (DEGEN)](https://indexed.finance/), by Indexed, and [Total Crypto Market Cap Token (TCAP)](https://cryptex.finance/) to see how they stack up.

### **StackUp Verdict**

DEGEN & TCAP each come with their own strengths to consider.

* Are you new to crypto or unsure which tokens to buy, but believe in the long-term growth of the crypto asset class and want broad exposure to it? - TCAP might be for you.
* Do you already have an established crypto portfolio and are just looking for exposure to an index of promising Ethereum protocols to round out your DeFi exposure? - DEGEN could be a good option to consider.
* Or perhaps you've called the top of the bull market and you want to open up a short position? - Both DEGEN and TCAP's minting capabilities offer this to advanced users.

There are certainly other considerations to keep in mind for your particular situation. But when you're evaluating index token options, whether they be DEGEN, TCAP, or something else, make sure you keep these key considerations in the back of your mind. Don't forget to stay tuned into Cryptex for more crypto index StackUps.

### About the Tokens

**DEGEN Index (DEGEN)**

The DEGEN Index, by Indexed, is a digital asset index with "a higher risk/reward index of promising Ethereum protocols that have significant room to grow". "Fundamentally, the index tokens themselves represent fractional ownership of assets in pools maintained by a fork of Balancer." For more information about the construction of Indexed's various indexes, visit [](https://docs.indexed.finance/introduction/faq/pool-faq)<https://docs.indexed.finance/introduction/faq/pool-faq>.

DEGEN rebalances with a 30-minute minimum update delay with a basket of 10 tokens. The relatively balanced distribution of top 5 assets by weight consists of REN (16%), 1INCH (12%), RSR (11%), ALPHA (10%), and OCEAN (9%) for a little under 50% of the index's holdings.

**Total Cryptocurrency Market Capitalization (TCAP)**

Total Crypto Market Cap Token (TCAP), by the Cryptex team, is designed to give investors accurate, real-time price exposure to the total capitalization of the cryptocurrency market via a single, synthetic asset. Data from a number of oracles is aggregated in order to establish a total market cap median value, which is then bridged on-chain through an audited Chainlink Smart Contract.

TCAP rebalances in real-time and by design includes everything: DeFi, DeFi Indexes, Stablecoins, Governance Tokens, Asset-back tokens, and wrapped tokens. For more information, visit [](https://cryptex.finance/)<https://cryptex.finance/>.
