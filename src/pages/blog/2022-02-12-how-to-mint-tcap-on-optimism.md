Cryptex Finance provides users access to the markets of tomorrow. In an effort to get Cryptex Finance on a L2 while not sacrificing security, governance, and decentralization we've decided to begin our L2 journey on Optimism. Check out the launch blog post here:

Below is a step by step guide on how to mint TCAP using ETH on Optimism. You’re also able to mint TCAP using DAI, LINK, UNI, SNX on Optimism as well, but for this guide, we are going to utilize ETH.

You can also try this out on testnet if you want to get comfortable with how to use it: [](https://cryptex.finance/blog/2021-12-15-how-to-mint-tcap-on-optimism-testnet/)<https://cryptex.finance/blog/2021-12-15-how-to-mint-tcap-on-optimism-testnet/>

## STEP 1

**Have ETH available to use in a decentralized wallet.**

*(If you already have a decentralized wallet you can move on to step 2.)*

* Create a MetaMask wallet on [](https://metamask.io/)<https://metamask.io/>. Other decentralized wallets like Coinbase Wallet will work as well but for this guide, we will be using MetaMask.
* Use desktop (the preferred experience) not mobile

## STEP 2

**Add Optimism to your MetaMask wallet.**

*(If you have Optimism added already you can move on to Step 3.)*

* Go to [chainlist.org](http://chainlist.org)
* Search Optimism
* Select Optimism that shows ChainID 10 and Currency ETH
* A pop up will show in your MetaMask wallet, click Next, click Connect
* Click on Add to MetaMask under Optimism 
* A pop up will show in your MetaMask wallet, click Approve, then click Switch Network

## STEP 3

**Send ETH from Ethereum Mainnet to Optimism**

There are a few ways to bridge ETH from Ethereum Mainnet to Optimism, like Optimism gateway [](https://gateway.optimism.io/)<https://gateway.optimism.io/> and aggregators like Zapper, Zerion and Matcha. For this guide, we will use Hop.

* Simply visit [](https://app.hop.exchange/#/send)<https://app.hop.exchange/#/send>
* Select From as “Mainnet” and enter in the amount of ETH you want to send
* Select To as “Optimism”
* Click Approve and confirm the transaction
* Click Send and confirm the transaction

## STEP 4

**Create a Vault**

* Visit app.cryptex.finance/vault
* Make sure your network is set to the Optimism NOT mainnet or another network
* Click Create Vault then approve the MetaMask transaction
* Click Approve Vault then approve the MetaMask transaction

**Deposit ETH as collateral**

* Enter an amount of ETH under Add Collateral (Staked Collateral)
* Click the +
* Approve the transactions in MetaMask
