Hello Everyone,

Welcome to the 3rd edition of our weekly series, during which we perform technical analysis on the total crypto market capitalization (TCAP).

To familiarize yourself with the indicators and concepts we discuss here, [please refer to my intro post](https://cryptex.finance/blog/2021-10-09-tcap-technical-analysis-intro-post/), which is a detailed introduction/overview of technical analysis, and the indicators we will be using in these weekly posts. Also, you can find [last week's analysis here.](https://cryptex.finance/blog/2021-10-31-total-crypto-market-capitalization-weekly-technical-analysis-2-oct-31-2021/)

The information we present here can be utilized for profit using $TCAP, the first synthetic & collateralized asset which encompasses the entire crypto market. Find all the info on $TCAP and how you can use it as a tool for your benefit and as a hedge against your investments in singular assets here - [About Cryptex Finance](https://cryptex.finance/#about)

However, for this analysis, we will be using the TOTAL crypto market chart (Calculated by TradingView). I am using TOTAL since the $TCAP chart has not matured enough to provide a complete picture of the market's history. Later on, as time progresses, we will switch our analysis to the $TCAP chart, as it allows us to make hypothetical investments and apply them to our study.

DISCLAIMER: These articles will represent my thoughts and are in no way intended to be used as a recommendation or as financial advice. This is for educational and research purposes ONLY. I want to re-state that we will be adopting an agnostic/neutral view of the market. We will not be thinking about what we want/wish to happen but instead what we believe will most likely occur.

TA is simply deriving the events that we think have the highest probability of occurring, not predicting the future. Life can always throw us a curveball or two. With that being said, let's get into this week's analysis:

## 4-Hour **Chart:**

![TCAP 4-Hour Chart Nov 7](/img/4hr-chart-11-7.jpeg)

**Analysis:** This week I've decided to use the 4-hour chart instead of the daily chart as I feel it is more descriptive and clear for now. We see the Bollinger Bands tightening up at marker #1 which suggests that a bigger move is coming, as we have seen happen every time the bands tightened previously. Marker #2, remains the resistance and after dipping the last time this level was tested, the price recovered and is about to test this level again. We see three consecutive higher lows, and higher highs at points 1, 2, & 3 which confirms the bull market is still intact.

**Thoughts:** I expect the price to move up from here to test the previous ATH ($2.76T) due to the Bollinger Bands tightening, suggesting a big move is coming, and the 3 consecutive higher lows & highs. I believe we are about to see the price testing the $2.8T level and surpassing it.

### 4-Hour Indicators:

![TCAP 4-Hour Indicators Nov 7](/img/4hr-indicators-11-7.jpeg)

* MACD: MACD recently put in a bullish cross suggesting the price will increase. We can also see that this cross is at a relatively low level which suggests there is room to grow.
* RSI: RSI pointing sharply upwards. Also far from being in undersold levels, suggesting the price will move up and have room to grow.
* OBV: Pointing upwards and has passed previous resistance. In alignment with the other indicators.

## Weekly Chart:

![TCAP Weekly Chart Nov 7](/img/weekly-chart-11-7.jpeg)

**Analysis:** The horizontal blue line representing the previous ATH at ~$2.6T level was tested at and rejected at markers #1 & #2. After the second test and a slight dip, we saw the price increase to surpass this level and put in a new slightly higher ATH at just under the $2.8T level. The price now seems to be increasing and is about to test the new ATH at marker #3. The volume at marker #4 seems to have been strictly buying for the past 6 weeks and the volume this week is spiking suggesting there has been an influx of new buyers as soon as the price passed the previous ATH levels.

**Thoughts:** The spike in volume suggests some buyers were waiting to pass the previous resistance points to come in and push the price higher. We haven't seen any euphoric price explosion which suggests that the move is healthy and will continue. The previous leg up saw 7 straight green weekly bars, and with this leg we see 6 green bars, so we could have 1-2 more green weeks before the next dip. I believe the bull-market still has quite some room to move up because it has only just surpassed the previous ATH.

### Weekly Indicators:

![TCAP Weekly Indicators Nov 7](/img/weekly-indicators-11-7.jpeg)

* MACD: The MACD is continuing its bullish cross and does not look like dipping in the short-term. We see that it is approaching the previous highs. The slope is not very sharp which suggests the move hasn't been exhausted yet and is on the way to moving higher.
* RSI: The RSI seems to have slightly passed the previous resistance at the undersold level and is moving into undersold territory. If we see a price break-out, the importance of the RSI being undersold will be diminished and we will see it move up sharply until the move is complete as we saw during the previous ATH.
* OBV: Pointing upwards and having passed all previous resistance and in discovery mode.

## **Monthly Chart:**

![TCAP Monthly Chart Nov 7](/img/monthly-chart-11-7.jpeg)

**Analysis:** This month's candle started out in the red as we expected in the previous analysis, then went on to surpass last month's ATH slightly. As the TCAP is an index, it is only considered in a bull market as it puts in new ATH's consistently every candle.

**Thoughts:** Considering the 4-hour chart, and weekly chart suggested this upwards move will continue, I expect this month's candle to be solid green by the time it closes. We will see a significant price increase past the $2.8T level possibly to the $3T level or more before we see the next big dip. At least for the next week, this monthly candle will be strong and solid green.

### Monthly Indicators:

![TCAP Monthly Indicators Nov 7](/img/monthly-indicators-11-7.jpeg)

* MACD: The MACD is continuing its bullish cross and entering very high levels. I don't expect this to continue throughout the whole month, and expect the blue line to dip but not put in a bearish cross this month.
* RSI: Pointing slightly sideways in undersold level, but has passed resistance. I expect it to continue upwards.
* OBV: Testing its highest ever resistance and pointing sharply upwards, I expect it to surpass resistance which suggests the price will move higher with it.

## Crypto Volatility Index:

*(Source: [cvi.finance](https://cvi.finance/))*

**Analysis:** The interesting thing to me this week is how tight the range of the volatility index is. Throughout the past, we haven't seen this trend-line move so horizontal as if it is a straight line. Is this indicative of an incoming explosion in volatility? Or perhaps that crypto is more stable now as it is much more mainstream? I expect that the tighter the volatility currently, the more substantial it will be in the future, but as we haven't much evidence of this we will have to wait and see the effect of this.
