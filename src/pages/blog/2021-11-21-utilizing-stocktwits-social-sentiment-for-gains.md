### Social Sentiment & Trading

Some might argue that the importance of social sentiment is a new thing that arrived with the explosion of amateur retail trading over the internet. *Wallstreetbets* is a subreddit that gained worldwide notoriety for its plays on *GameStop* and *AMC* stocks, having grown to over 10 million members over the course of a single year. People of all nationalities and backgrounds congregate there to present their ideas for the next big thing that’s going to shake the world. Their determination and unity have both minted millionaires for some and resulted in huge losses for others. One thing was clear though, the dynamics of trading would never be the same.

The crypto world would also see a similar phenomenon when a community of people had banded together to take *Dogecoin*, a coin created as a joke, *‘to the moon.*’ *Doge*, which many people doubted would ever reach the price of $.01, went on to reach an all-time high of $0.75. This spurred the creation of thousands of meme tokens that had their own communities dreaming of taking their respective stock/crypto to heights that would leave the on-lookers that missed out with gut-wrenching regret. This proved that this culture of retail traders, who branded themselves as *apes*, had taken a piece of the crypto pie and are coming for more.

### What is Stocktwits?

In the background of these events, one company was quietly creating a social platform for traders & investors to congregate to share their thoughts & feelings about each and every respective investment asset that existed online. **[Stocktwits](https://stocktwits.com/)** had created a virtual watering hole where each contributor could not only write out their ideas but also select whether they were *bullish* or *bearish* on the ticker they were posting about. For all the assets that exist on the platform, this feature **quantifies** social sentiment. The most-discussed tickers are listed on a trending page for all users to see.

### The Impact of Social Sentiment

*Some* might argue that because social sentiment is a new concept when it comes to trading, it’s not something crucial to your trading strategy and is irrelevant. However, is it really something that became relevant during the recent days of internet trading, or has social sentiment always been a huge factor that swayed the market?

Back when most traders stood on the floors of exchanges, rather than sat in front of their computer or phone screens, the social sentiment on the actual floor was a driving force for many of their plays. From what I’ve heard from the traders that did stand on the floors of exchanges and what I’ve read in the books of some of the most prolific traders & investors, is that there were a select few traders that had the *Midas* touch. They were the first movers, the ones that had the inside scoop, the ones that started moves, and the rest followed. It is said that these people would make a trade that would travel from trader to trader that followed in their footsteps to the point where they would gather around and wait on their every move.

This dynamic has been captured *perfectly* on the **Stocktwits** platform. Some influential traders have amassed thousands of followers who wait for them to post their trades, strategies, price targets, & any other information they wish to put out for them to decide on whether to pull the trigger and follow their lead.

### My Stocktwits Tips

1. Filter out the noise. It's not about the *quantity* of people you follow, rather the *quality*.
2. Stay clear of people who only talk about their wins. Losses are a **normal** part of trading.
3. Be wary of people offering guarantees. **Nothing** is guaranteed.
4. Do not buy into one-sided sentiment boards. When the *masses* think one thing, usually the *opposite* happens.
5. **Never** make a decision that is not completely **your own**.

I *highly* discourage anyone from blindly following someone else’s moves/trades without doing their own research first. I once completely disregarded outside opinions & ideas and traded only in a bubble of my own thoughts and plans. However, growing in this space humbles anyone including doctors, lawyers, engineers, or anyone else who thinks that because they are intelligent enough to succeed in their own profession, they will find trading to be a walk in the park.

I’ve learned that even though the space is full of scam artists and self-proclaimed gurus, it is also full of brilliant individuals who have extremely valuable & diverse insights that could not only give me an idea for my next move but also show me how these people think & how to view the market from a perspective different from my own. You never stop learning in this space as it is not a stable science but rather a growing ecosystem of human beings that change and adapt as time passes by.

There is plenty to soak up on Stocktwits. Do your best to learn on your own and see how your views match up with successful traders. Attempt to not only *view* another trader's calls but to also *understand* their thinking & the psychology behind *why* they do what they do. The market is, after all, just a group of these people applying their thoughts and feelings into actions.
