Hello Everyone,

Welcome to the 12th edition of our weekly series, during which we perform technical analysis on the total crypto market capitalization (TCAP).

To familiarize yourself with the indicators and concepts we discuss here, [please refer to my intro post](https://cryptex.finance/blog/2021-10-09-tcap-technical-analysis-intro-post/), which is a detailed introduction/overview of technical analysis, and the indicators we will be using in these weekly posts. Also, you can find [last week's analysis here.](https://cryptex.finance/blog/2022-01-25-total-crypto-market-capitalization-weekly-technical-analysis-10-jan-25th-2022/)

The information we present here can be utilized for profit using $TCAP, the first synthetic & collateralized asset which encompasses the entire crypto market. Find all the info on $TCAP and how you can use it as a tool for your benefit and as a hedge against your investments in singular assets here - [About Cryptex Finance](https://cryptex.finance/#about)

However, for this analysis, we will be using the TOTAL crypto market chart (Calculated by TradingView). I am using TOTAL since the $TCAP chart has not matured enough to provide a complete picture of the market's history. Later on, as time progresses, we will switch our analysis to the $TCAP chart, as it allows us to make hypothetical investments and apply them to our study.

DISCLAIMER: These articles will represent my thoughts and are in no way intended to be used as a recommendation or as financial advice. This is for educational and research purposes ONLY. I want to re-state that we will be adopting an agnostic/neutral view of the market. We will not be thinking about what we want/wish to happen but instead what we believe will most likely occur.

TA is simply deriving the events that we think have the highest probability of occurring, not predicting the future. Life can always throw us a curveball or two. With that being said, let's get into this week's analysis:

## Daily Chart

![](/img/02132022-dc.png)

**Analysis:** The market failed to put in a new higher high above $2.1T TCAP, thus it is still considered in a down-trend. As it stands, TCAP is at a crucial point. A drop under $1.8T could see a new low set at around $1.3T TCAP. A rally from here to above $2.1T would signal the end of the downtrend and begin a new cycle of either consolidation or upwards movement.

However, no clear direction can be deduced based on this chart. The indicators we do have present a bearish outlook. Volume has been primarily red. Sellers are still in control as of now. That could quickly change if a new high over $2.1T is set, as that will attract new buyers and scare sellers.

### Daily Indicators

* **MACD:** About to put in a bearish cross. Indicating price will continue lower.
* **RSI:** Pointing sharply down after rejection at a near undersold level. Indicating price will continue lower.
* **OBV:** Pointing down, in line with all the other indicators in presenting a bearish outlook.

Because of how unclear the chart itself is at the moment, let's look at what we know:

1. TCAP failed to put in a new higher-high which would have signaled the bottom of the downtrend. Thus, we must assume that the price is still in a down-trend.
2. All indicators, including volume, present a bearish outlook.

So, if we have to make a deduction, we can assume that the odds of the price going down are higher than up.

## Weekly Chart

**Analysis:** This week’s candle seems to be closing as a ‘gravestone doji’ candle. This candle shape is considered bearish, and indicates the following candle will also be red. Also, there appears to be a bear-flag formation. If the price drops under $1.7T, this formation will be confirmed and a drop to ~$1.3T TCAP is almost inevitable.

Examples of a gravestone doji:

This may not always prove accurate as single candles are not as strong of an indicator as a multiple-candle pattern. However, the odds are higher for a heavy selloff after a gravestone doji than not. A drop under $1.7T will lead to a significant drop to support that stands around $1.3T TCAP. The lack of support under this level could entice bears/sellers to continue to bring the price lower.

### Weekly Indicators

* **MACD:** Flattened out, yet not curling up to put in another bullish cross. Unusual, and indicative of price stagnation/consolidation.
* **RSI:** Pointing downwards. Indicating price will continue lower.
* **OBV:** Pointing downwards. Indicating price will continue lower.

## Monthly Chart

**Analysis:** In the grand scheme of things, I believe that the monthly chart remains the most bullish of all. As you can see, the TCAP put in an ATH, at $2.5T, a low at around $1.1T, then a new higher-high at $3T, and has bounced from what could be considered a new higher-low at $1.5T. This leads us to the assumption that the market should put in a new high over $3T from here. A drop under $1.5T could be devastating however and throw this uptrend into disarray.

## Monthly Indicators

* **MACD:** Continuing bearish cross indicating price will continue lower.
* **RSI:** Curling up. Indicating price could rise from here.
* **OBV:** Curling up. Indicating price could rise from here.

**Final Thoughts:** Sometimes the market does not give us a clear indication of what the next move is. We are at a crucial point where we cannot confirm the continuation of a downtrend or uptrend. The daily, and weekly charts & indicators are bearish, while the monthly remains bullish. We will need to watch the $2.1T resistance and $1.7T support. If one of these levels is broken, we can have a much clearer idea of what's next. This is a good time to stay out of the market and wait for confirmation to act.
