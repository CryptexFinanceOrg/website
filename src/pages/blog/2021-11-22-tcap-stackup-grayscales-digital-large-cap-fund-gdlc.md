Does the sheer number of different cryptocurrencies make your head spin? Or perhaps keeping track of the taxable events while rebalancing your portfolio and having to shell out for gas fees has you down? Enter crypto index tokens: offering broad crypto exposure, savings on gas fees, and automatic rebalancing - all to make your investing journey easier. However, as always in crypto, there's more than one option to choose from; let's dig into the [Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC)](https://grayscale.com/products/grayscale-decentralized-finance-fund/), by Grayscale, and [Total Crypto Market Cap Token (TCAP)](https://cryptex.finance/) to see how they stack up.

### **StackUp Verdict**

GDLC & TCAP each come with their own strengths to consider.

* Are you new to crypto or unsure which tokens to buy, but believe in the long-term growth of the crypto asset class and want broad exposure to it? - TCAP might be for you.
* Do you want exposure to ~80% of the crypto assets in your brokerage or IRA account? - GDLC could be a good option to consider.
* Or perhaps you've called the top of the bull market and you want to open up a short position? - Both GDLC and TCAP support this; GDLC through opening a short position in a brokerage account, and TCAP through its minting and secondary market capabilities.

There are certainly other factors to consider, but when you evaluate index token options, whether they be GDLC, TCAP, or something else, make sure you keep these key considerations in the back of your mind. Don't forget to stay tuned into Cryptex for more crypto index StackUps.

### About the Tokens

**Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC)**

Grayscale's Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC) is an investment vehicle that enables investors to gain access and exposure to the upper 70% of the digital currency market in the form of a security without the challenges of buying, storing, and safekeeping digital currencies directly. The Fundâ€™s shares are among the first securities solely invested in, and deriving value from, a basket of digital currencies.

GDLC rebalances quarterly; the fund's composition (as of 10/29/2021) includes BTC (62%), ETH (27%), ADA (3.5%), SOL (3.2%), and less than 1% of each: UNI, LINK, LTC, and BCH.

**Total Cryptocurrency Market Capitalization (TCAP)**

Total Crypto Market Cap Token (TCAP), by the Cryptex team, is designed to give investors accurate, real-time price exposure to the total capitalization of the cryptocurrency market via a single, synthetic asset. Data from a number of oracles is aggregated in order to establish a total market cap median value, which is then bridged on-chain through an audited Chainlink Smart Contract.

TCAP rebalances in real-time and by design includes everything: DeFi, DeFi Indexes, Stablecoins, Governance Tokens, Asset-back tokens, and wrapped tokens. For more information, visit [](https://cryptex.finance/)<https://cryptex.finance/>.
