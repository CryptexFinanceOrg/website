Hello Everyone,

Welcome to the 13th edition of our weekly series, during which we perform technical analysis on the total crypto market capitalization (TCAP).

To familiarize yourself with the indicators and concepts we discuss here, [please refer to my intro post](https://cryptex.finance/blog/2021-10-09-tcap-technical-analysis-intro-post/), which is a detailed introduction/overview of technical analysis, and the indicators we will be using in these weekly posts. Also, you can find [last week's analysis here.](https://cryptex.finance/blog/2022-02-14-total-crypto-market-capitalization-weekly-technical-analysis-12-feb-13th-2022/)

The information we present here can be utilized for profit using $TCAP, the first synthetic & collateralized asset which encompasses the entire crypto market. Find all the info on $TCAP and how you can use it as a tool for your benefit and as a hedge against your investments in singular assets here - [About Cryptex Finance](https://cryptex.finance/#about)

However, for this analysis, we will be using the TOTAL crypto market chart (Calculated by TradingView). I am using TOTAL since the $TCAP chart has not matured enough to provide a complete picture of the market's history. Later on, as time progresses, we will switch our analysis to the $TCAP chart, as it allows us to make hypothetical investments and apply them to our study.

DISCLAIMER: These articles will represent my thoughts and are in no way intended to be used as a recommendation or as financial advice. This is for educational and research purposes ONLY. I want to re-state that we will be adopting an agnostic/neutral view of the market. We will not be thinking about what we want/wish to happen but instead what we believe will most likely occur.

TA is simply deriving the events that we think have the highest probability of occurring, not predicting the future. Life can always throw us a curveball or two. With that being said, let's get into this week's analysis:

## Daily Chart

![](/img/dc.png)

**Analysis:** First, I would like to address the question: “Is the market still in a down-trend?” - Going back to the basics, the end of a downtrend is confirmed when the price puts in a higher-high, and higher-low than the past two highs and lows. As you can see from the chart above, there is no confirmed higher-high and higher-low, thus we must continue with the assumption that the market is still in a downtrend. Therefore, we will continue to assume that it will go lower.

Second, I want to point out the formation of a possible head-and-shoulders pattern on the TOTAL daily chart:

![](/img/dc2.png)

The ‘Head-and-Shoulders’ pattern is a bearish indicator. Should the price go lower than \~$1.5T (Support for right shoulder) we can reasonably assume the price will continue lower to reach the support of the left shoulder at around \~$1.1T TCAP.

I expanded on this by adding support/resistance lines to the above chart:

![](/img/dc3.png)

For the downtrend to end, the market has to drop no further than $1.5T TCAP, then rise to the resistance at $1.8T, and then go no lower than $1.6T, and continue to break the major resistance at $2.1T TCAP. This seems like an unlikely scenario at the moment.

We could see a rise from here back to the $1.8T resistance, and back down under $1.6T to the $1.5T support, then back to $1.6T, before a big breakdown under $1.5T to go all the way down to $1.1T - $1.2T.

At this point, a price breakdown to $1.5T and under seems like the more likely scenario, assuming the market is still in a down-trend, and that markets go from extreme-highs to extreme-lows and rarely ever stay at fair-value middle-ground.

Should the market drop to the $1.1T - $1.2T range, this will be devastating to most bulls, as it will be the second test of this low within a one-year period. Most will have hoped never to see these levels again, and many will face capitulation. It would be fair to assume the price has a much higher chance of breaking under that level than holding.

### Daily Indicators

![](/img/di.png)

* **MACD:** Continuing bearish cross with no sign of curling up, indicating price will continue lower.
* **RSI:** Curling up after hitting oversold level. Indicating price will rise.
* **OBV:** Curling up slightly, indicating price will increase.

## Weekly Chart

![](/img/wc.png)

**Analysis:** Head-and-shoulders pattern presents itself here in the weekly chart as well. $1.6T - $1.5T support is the area to watch. These levels must hold to avoid a further $300B drop in TCAP. Moreover, the last 3 red weekly candles could resemble a ‘3 red soldiers’ pattern, should this week’s candle touch the $1.5T level. 3 white soldiers & 3 red soldiers’ patterns usually indicate a coming breakout.

Example of 3 white/green & red soldiers:

Also sometimes referred to as “3 Black Crows”

If this pattern were to complete by having this week’s candle close/touch the $1.5T level, we can assume that there will be a slight bump to $1.6T before continuing lower to touch the $1.2T range.

### Weekly Indicators

* **MACD:** Continuing lower after bearish cross, indicating price will continue lower.
* **RSI:** Sideways in a downtrend, indicating price will consolidate downwards.
* **OBV:** Headed downwards, indicating price will continue lower.

## Monthly Chart

![](/img/mc.png)

**Analysis:** The current month’s candle is forming what is considered an inverted hammer candle, which is a bearish indication.

Example of ‘Inverted Hammer”

![](/img/inverted-hammer.png)

Usually after an inverted hammer, the following candle is red as well. Thus, we can assume that the current candle will either stop at $1.6T support or continue lower to the next support at around $1.5T, which also happens to be the 20-month SMA. This should prove to be a strong support level, and we should see some type of bounce from here. However, if the candle closes in the $1.5T - $1.6T range, the inverted hammer tells us that the next candle will also close red. This is why we can assume that the $1.5T level will be broken and the price will fall under the 20-month SMA for the first time since March 2020. If this happens, we can safely assume that the price will continue lower to touch and bounce off of the 50-month SMA, just like the last time this event occurred. This level stands at ~$750B TCAP which I believe, at the moment, will be the very bottom of this bear-market.

### Monthly Indicators

![](/img/mi.png)

* **RSI:** Sideways on a downtrend, indicating price will continue lower.
* **OBV:** Continuing lower under support, indicating lower volume and price incoming.
* **MACD Histogram:** I decided to include the Histogram on this timeframe because it is a more visual representation of what’s going on. The histogram is turning red for the first time since June 2020. The last time this happened was during the bear-market of 2018. This is the biggest indication that the TCAP is going into a deep bear-market, and will continue lower for a while.

## Bitcoin Dominance Chart ($BTC.D)

![](/img/btcd.png)

**Analysis:** I decided to include this monthly chart in this week’s analysis because I noticed a huge break in a long-term trend. BTC.D seems to be sitting at strong support, the RSI & OBV are pointing sharply upwards, indicating Bitcoin dominance will rise to at least 50%. The biggest indication is that the MACD crossover is about to put in a bullish cross for the first time since May 2018. When this happened in 2018, TCAP continued to lose 60% of its value in the coming months. History doesn’t repeat itself, but it often rhymes.
