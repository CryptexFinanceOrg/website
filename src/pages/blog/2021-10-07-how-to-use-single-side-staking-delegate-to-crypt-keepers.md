1. Head over to the staking & delegating section of the app: [](https://app.cryptex.finance/governance)<https://app.cryptex.finance/governance> the best experience will be on desktop/laptop.
2. Select a Crypt Keeper (Can be more than one) you want to stake & delegate your CTX to. Be sure to read their bios and interact with them on Discord and/or Twitter to better understand how they'll impact future proposals for the protocol.

7. That's it! Your CTX is now staked and delegated to Crypt Keepers who will be responsible for active involvement in the governance of the protocol.

### Some things to note:

* 60,000 CTX added to the pool for staking, zero lockup, rewards 100% per block basis for 6 months
* APY will begin to calculate once rewards go live
* Once you stake you have to wait a minimum of 7 days to withdraw
* Actively vet the Crypt Keeper(s) before you delegate your CTX to them
