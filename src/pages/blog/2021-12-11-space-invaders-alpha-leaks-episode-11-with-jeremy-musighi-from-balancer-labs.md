Cryptex (CTX) the protocol and community behind Total Crypto Market Cap token (TCAP), is constantly inspired and impressed with the creators and builders of web3. Cryptex created Space Invaders to help people get an inside look into the minds of the most important web3 creators and builders of our time.

On December 3rd Cryptex welcomed BFresh and Jeremy Musighi, as our hosts. Cryptex featured Jeremy Musighi as our guest for the 11th episode of Space Invaders. Jeremy Musighi is the head of growth at Balancer Labs and an investor. Typically these episodes are recorded live on Twitter Spaces then published on YouTube and a variety of podcast platforms.

In this post, we are sharing the most thought-provoking and alpha-infused pieces of the conversation. These are things most people would not get a chance to find out unless they were listening to the conversation at air time, which you can find on our Youtube channel and podcast formats.

Read on for the alpha leaks from Space Invaders Episode 11 with Jeremy Musighi from Balancer Labs.

**BFresh:** For those who aren't familiar with what Balancer is, or maybe even how it works. Would you be able to give us an explanation of what it is?

**Jeremy:** Sure. Balancer is primarily three things at the same time.

\-One, which is probably what most people know it for is that it's a Decentralized Exchange and Automated Market Maker that allows you to trade any token for any other token within the Ethereum ecosystem.

\-2nd, it's an Automated Portfolio Manager where you can utilize Balancers liquidity pools as a way to productively earn yield passively on your crypto investments. You can invest in something and then you can take that thing in and invest it again, and so on to compound your gains. The liquidity pools on Balancer and the Decentralized Exchange have this synergetic like, mirror relationship where the capital that you put into Balancer pools is fueling and operating the exchange. It's providing the liquidity for these markets. And by doing so you're rewarded with trading fees that are generated by the protocol.

\-3rd, I think it's the one that I find the most exciting, is that it's a platform for development. Balancer as a protocol is designed in a way that is super flexible, super generalizable. It applies to so many different use cases. I truly have no hesitation in saying, **I think Balancer can grow into the largest protocol in DeFi because of its design and because of all of the ways that it can be used**. And that's what makes it a developer platform because when you take the concept of an AMM or a liquidity pool and you make it so that the parameters can be super customizable, for example liquidity pools can hold multiple assets. On our current release of balancer V2 pools, they can hold up to 50 tokens in one pool on the high end. And the weights of the tokens in a liquidity pool are fully customizable as well. The swap fees are customizable. We have multiple different types of pools that can be used for an infinite number of use cases.

It's a very wide design space where you can take a liquidity pool, and configure it. And, from that emerges, a use case that you definitely cannot use another AMM to create.

**BFresh:** So I guess, you could probably say that one of the most important factors for Balancer's growth is probably its flexibility ? Like the ability to adapt to whatever the developer's needs are ?

**Jeremy:** Absolutely. One of the main focus for me has always been building relationships, partnerships, integrations with other projects in the space, helping them navigate the various features and possibilities that you can use Balancer for.

**BFresh:** And in this always changing space, how do you keep Balancer as like a leader ?

**Jeremy:** If Balancer is providing value to the developer community, and there are innovative, valuable, useful, technologies being built on Balancer or integrated with Balancer, then that's how Balancer grows and remains relevant in this changing landscape.

Today, you have projects like Fade protocol. They're building Fade protocol V2 on Balancer. They're using Balancer's managed pools, which is a new type of liquidity pool that we're going to be releasing soon, to manage their Protocol Controlled Value (PCV). It's a crucial component of how their new version of the protocol works. They're also using Balancer's Liquidity Bootstrapping Pools (LBPs), which really had a lot of momentum lately. For anyone who's not familiar, it's a mechanism for conducting an IDO or doing a token sale in the most fair, transparent way possible. They're also utilizing that as a tool, as a token buyback mechanism, which also factors into the strategy of their protocol and their ecosystem.

So these are projects that trust Balancer's tech to build the core functionalities of their product.

**BFresh:** I never really thought of Balancer as this, it's not only a front end kind of user-facing product, but as you mentioned, it's an Automated Portfolio Manager. But it's also infrastructure for a ton of projects !

### Alpha

**Jeremy:** One of the ways that Balancer is seeing a lot of traction today is that's a platform for building structured investment products like index funds. And, you know, obviously the wheelhouse of crypto tech is being this: crypto market cap tracking, index token essentially. I don't want to describe it for you because you guys can do that much better than me.

**BFresh:** I would love to hear more about that. So how would that differ from the current state of the Balancer protocol? Would there be any differences within the protocol that needs to be made to have stuff like that or that type of tech is already available already ?

**Jeremy:** It's a fundamental emerging feature that comes from Balancer's design. You can create multi-asset liquidity pools on Balancer. You can set the weights that the pool must maintain in each asset. And then you hold a token, a BPT that represents your share in that pool. That token is synonymous to an Index Fund asset, that token represents your diversified investment into all of the underlying assets that are held in that pool.

This was, you know, part of the original vision for Balancer and today it's definitely gaining traction and we're going to see some really exciting partners that are going to be utilizing these features. And I think that that's an area of the Balancer ecosystem that has a lot of growth potential.

**BFresh:** One question I did have was around MEV (Miner Extractable Value: high gas cost and security of the network). Does Balancer do anything to combat this ?

**Jeremy:** Balancer V2 is designed in what's called this single volt architecture. So every liquidity pool on Balancer is actually contained within one vault, which is one big highly secure smart contract. And that has many reasons and benefits to it. When you trade tokens from one Balancer pool to another, you are not actually needing to perform an online transfer, on chain transfer function, because you're not actually moving tokens from one smart contract address to another, you're just reconfiguring the accounting within the same contract. That means that your gas costs would be lower than the alternative.

The second thing is that we recently launched a partnership with Cowswap, from the Gnosis team. They have a really innovative approach in terms of protecting traders from MEV, where they essentially batch trades together and make swaps happen more directly. And that's now integrated into the Balancer trading interface. So every trade that you make at [Balancer.fi](http://Balancer.fi) is fully protected from MEV. It's also going to get you the best price across Cowswap, which is connected to the whole DEXs in the space, essentially.
