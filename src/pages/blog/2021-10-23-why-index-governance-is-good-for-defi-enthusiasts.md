The decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem has expanded to the point where users eagerly take the opportunity to shape the direction of the projects they identify with. Participating in governance on a project also means that you have invested in it. Therefore, it is in participants' best interest to guide the project in the best interest of its long-term success.

DAO governance gives participants the ability to directly affect how the userbase of an index protocol can grow over time, and how the governance token may increase in value. One could look at this as having a direct impact on the future of finance and wealth.

In the case of decentralized indexes in DeFi, DAO governance involves making decisions on the protocol's inner workings, such as choosing which assets may be included and what weightings they bear on an index.

All the same can be said about the governance of Cryptex's TCAP index protocol. With Cryptex ([CTX](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/cryptex-finance)), the governance token for the protocol, users have the right to vote on and make proposals about the functionality of the TCAP Index. The impact of decentralized governance decisions have long-lasting effects, so it's important for those new to it to understand the ramifications of how they interact with governance in DeFi.

## Why should DeFi enthusiasts care about a crypto index?

Indexes represent an essential tool for speculative traders and market analysts alike. For traders, indexes have become a popular way to "match the market, not beat it," as [William Sharpe](https://web.stanford.edu/~wfsharpe/art/talks/indexed_investing.htm) wrote in his Stanford paper. Buying an index token like TCAP on Sushiswap or Gemini is cheaper and more tax-efficient than accumulating each individual asset the index represents.

Conversely, market analysts use indexes to help determine the health of the market based on the basket of assets an index takes into account.

The TCAP Index uses the dollar value of the entire crypto market capitalization to determine its valur. The simplicity of this index's applications present the market with a simple tool that even first-time DEX traders can use to get a quick overview of the health of the market. This is the first index of its type in the crypto market, and is expected to be widely integrated into DeFi applications as one of the standard tools used to measure the health of the crypto markets.

While the TCAP Index is far from the only index being used by DeFi enthusiasts and those in the general crypto community, it makes a strong case for its inherent benefits.

## Governance Is Key

For an index with as much impact as Cryptex's is expected to have, governance must be of the highest concern. The more the index is adopted, the higher the stakes of governance decisions made for it. This is where the Cryptex governance token, CTX, finds its utility.

Chances are, most DeFi enthusiasts know the ins and outs of decentralized governance via crypto and have received lucrative airdrops for their participations. CTX works much the same as other governance tokens.

CTX hodlers can vote on important issues that affect the TCAP index, such as [what chains](https://forum.cryptex.finance/t/cip-6-deploying-tcap-into-polygon/92) the index may be used on, [what tokens to add](https://forum.cryptex.finance/t/what-should-be-the-next-asset-added-as-vault-collateral/51) to the treasury vault of the DAO, and even what hodlers [can do with their tokens](https://forum.cryptex.finance/t/staking-of-ctx-for-governance/126) when they aren't being used on votes. Just like with any DAO or crypto project with decentralized governance, robust participation and discussion improves the outlook of the project as more input leads to more utilization.

Participation can be incentivized with airdrops or rewards for people who make proposals that get passed. Such incentives encourage a higher volume of participation. Greater participation means more value in the project and its governance tokens. The effects begin to snowball, where increased participation generates demand for the privilege to participate, and then more capital begins to flow into the DAO for further incentives.

All of the points made here lead us to a few conclusions. First, crypto indexes, namely Cryptex's TCAP index, are relatively new to the crypto market, but have the potential to become an important tool for traders and analysts. The TCAP Index in particular offers a single simple number which market players can use to get a rough overview of the health of the markets.

Second, governance of DeFi protocols is extremely important for the success of those protocols. Cryptex has taken index governance to a new level by introducing the [Crypt Keepers](https://app.cryptex.finance/governance). Under this system, users [stake their CTX](https://cryptex.finance/blog/2021-10-06-single-sided-staking-for-ctx-now-live/) tokens to delegate votes towards a Crypt Keeper who then becomes obligated to vote on and create proposals for the protocol (think: representative democracy).

At this early stage of the development of crypto indexes, it's clear to see that your input as a governance participant will have major lasting effects on the future of the crypto market - so, dive in and get staking!
