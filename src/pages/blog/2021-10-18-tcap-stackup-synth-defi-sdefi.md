Does the sheer number of different cryptocurrencies make your head spin? Or perhaps keeping track of the taxable events while rebalancing your portfolio and having to shell out for gas fees has you down? Enter crypto index tokens: offering broad crypto exposure, savings on gas fees, and automatic rebalancing - all to make your investing journey easier. However, as always in crypto, there's more than one option to choose from; let's dig into the [Synth DeFi (sDEFI)](https://www.synthetix.io/synths) index and [Total Crypto Market Cap Token (TCAP)](https://cryptex.finance/) to see how they stack up.

### **StackUp Verdict**

sDEFI & TCAP each come with their own strengths to consider.

* Are you new to crypto or unsure which tokens to buy, but believe in the long-term growth of the crypto asset class and want broad exposure to it? - TCAP might be for you.
* Do you already have an established crypto portfolio and are just looking for diversified exposure to a specific crypto market segment? - sDEFI's broad basket of 20 tokens could be a good option to consider.
* Or perhaps you've called the top of the bull market and you want to open up a short position? - TCAP's minting capabilities offer this to advanced users.

Certainly there are other considerations to keep in mind for your particular situation as well. But when you're evaluating index token options, whether they be an Indexed product, TCAP, or something else, make sure you keep these key considerations in the back of your mind. Don't forget to stay tuned into Cryptex for more crypto index StackUps.

### About the Tokens

**sDEFI**

The Synthetix team offers:

> "Synths are derivative tokens providing exposure to a range of assets. They can be traded with infinite liquidity and zero slippage by leveraging the Synthetix protocol’s unique pooled collateral model. Trades between Synths generate a small fee that is distributed to SNX collateral providers".

Users first deposit assets in exchange for synthetic US Dollars (sUSD) (0.30% fee) or synthetic Ether (sETH) (0.25% fee) which can then be exchanged on [](https://kwenta.io/)<https://kwenta.io/> for other Synthetix products, including the sDEFI index (1.00% fee). sDEFI offers holders synthetic exposure via a [Chainlink data feed](https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/indexes/sdefi-usd) to a basket of 20 tokens.

sDEFI rebalances in real-time with a relatively diversified basket of 20 tokens compared to compared to other popular index token basket products. The top 5 assets by weight consist of UNI (15%), AAVE (11%), LUNA (10%), MKR (9%) and RUNE (8%) for a little over 50% of the index's holdings.

**Total Cryptocurrency Market Capitalization (TCAP)**

Total Crypto Market Cap Token (TCAP), by the Cryptex team, is designed to give investors accurate, real-time price exposure to the total capitalization of the cryptocurrency market via a single, synthetic asset. Data from a number of oracles is aggregated in order to establish a total market cap median value, which is then bridged on-chain through an audited Chainlink Smart Contract.

TCAP rebalances in real-time and by design includes everything: DeFi, DeFi Indexes, Stablecoins, Governance Tokens, Asset-back tokens, and wrapped tokens. For more information, visit [](https://cryptex.finance/)<https://cryptex.finance/>.
